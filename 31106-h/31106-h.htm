<h2>Lovell's Canadian Authors' Series, No. 60.</h2>

<hr style="width: 10%;margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top:.2em;">

<p>The authoress is a Canadian, and her story is remarkably well told.&mdash;<i>Advertiser</i>,
London.</p>

<p>In this work a new aspirant for literary honors in the field of fiction
makes her first appearance before the public. The story which she tells
is neither lengthy nor involved. It is a simple, prettily told story of
love at first sight, with a happy ending, and little to divert the mind of
the reader from the hero and heroine. Mrs. Conger's literary style is
pleasing, and her production evidences a well cultured mind and a
tolerable appreciation of character. Her book will be found very
pleasant reading.&mdash;"<i>Intelligencer</i>," Belleville.</p>

<p>The plot is ingeniously constructed, and its working out furnishes the
opportunity for some dramatic situations. The heroine, of whose early
life the title gives us a hint, is a creature all grace and tenderness, a true
offspring of the sunny south. The hero is an American, a man of
wealth, and an artist <i>in posse</i>. The other <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>, who play
their parts around these central figures, are mostly Italians or Americans.
The great question to be solved is: Who is Merlina? In supplying the
solution, the author takes occasion to introduce us to an obscure but
interesting class of people. The denouement of "A Daughter of St.
Peter's" is somewhat startling, but we must not impair the reader's
pleasure by anticipation. We see from the advanced sheets that it is
dedicated to the Canadian public, to whom we cordially commend it.&mdash;<i>The
Gazette</i>, Montreal.</p>

<p>For a first effort, which the authoress in her preface modestly says
the novel is, "A Daughter of St. Peter's" must be pronounced a very
promising achievement. The plot is well constructed and the story
entertaining and well told. The style is light and agreeable, and with
a little more experience and facility in novel-writing we may expect
Mrs. Conger, if she essays a second trial, to produce a book that will
surpass the decided merits of "A Daughter of St. Peter's."&mdash;<i>Free Press</i>,
London.<a name="Page_4"></a></p>

<p class="chapterhead">THE END OF HER CHILDHOOD.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> Convent of the Annonciades, situated in a secluded
spot on the outskirts of Paris, has long been well reputed
as an educational establishment for young ladies of good
family. The sisters themselves are women of refinement
and cultivation, and the antecedents of every pupil received
by them are most carefully inquired into: so carefully, indeed,
that admission to the Convent School is looked on
almost as a certificate of noble birth and unimpeachable
orthodoxy. The Ladies of the Annonciades have indeed
lately relaxed their rules, so far as to receive as parlor-boarders
some very rich American girls and the children
of a Protestant English marquis; but wealth in the first
instance, and birth in the second, counterbalance the objections
that might be raised to their origin or their faith.
These exceptions to the rule are, however, few and far
between; and, in spite of the levelling tendencies of our
democratic days, Annonciades Convent is still one of the
most exclusive and aristocratic establishments of the kind
in Europe.</p>

<p>Although we know too well that small-minded jealousy,
strife, and bickering must exist in a community of women
cut off so entirely from the outer world as in this Convent
of the Annonciades, it must be confessed that the very
name and air of the place possess a certain romantic charm.
The house is old, turreted like a chateau, overgrown with
clematis and passion-flower. The grounds, enclosed by
high mossy walls, are of great extent, and beautifully laid<a name="Page_6"></a>
out. The long chestnut avenue, the sparkling fountains,
the trim flower-beds, are the delight of the sisters' hearts.
The green beauty of the garden, and the grey stones of the
ancient building, form a charming background for the white-veiled
women who glide with noiseless footsteps along the
cloisters or the avenue: a background more becoming to
them even than to the bevy of girls in their everyday grey
frocks, or their Sunday garb of white and blue. For the
sisters' quaint and graceful dress harmonizes with the
antique surroundings of building and ornament as anything
younger and more modern fails to do.</p>

<p>These women&mdash;shut off from the world, and knowing
little of its joys or sorrows&mdash;have a strangely tranquil air.
With some the tranquility verges on childishness. One
feels that they have not conquered the world, they have
but escaped it; and, as one pities the soldier who flies the
battle, so one mourns for the want of courage which has
condemned these women to an inglorious peace. But here
and there another kind of face is to be seen. Here and
there we come across a countenance bearing the tragic
impress of toil and grief and passion; and we feel it possible
that in this haven alone perhaps could a nature which
had striven and suffered so greatly find in the end a lasting
place. But such faces are fortunately few and far between.</p>

<p>From the wide low window of the great <i>salle d'&eacute;tude</i> a
flight of steps with carved stone balustrades led into the
garden. The balustrades were half-covered with clustering
white roses and purple clematis on the day of which I write;
and a breath of perfume, almost overpowering in its sweetness,
was wafted every now and then from the beds of
mignonette and lilies on either side. The brilliant sunshine
of an early September day was not yet touched with the
melancholy of autumn: the leaves of the Virginia creeper
had not yet changed to scarlet, nor had the chestnuts yellowed
as if winter was creeping on apace. Everything was
still, warm and bright.</p>

<p>The stillness was partly accounted for by the fact that
most of the pupils had gone home for their summer holidays.
The <i>salle d'&eacute;tude</i> was empty and a little desolate:
no hum of busy voices came from its open window to the
garden; and even the tranquil sisters seemed to miss the
sound, and to look wistfully at the bare desks and unused
benches of their schoolroom. For they loved their pupils<a name="Page_7"></a>
and their work; both came, perhaps, as a welcome break
in the monotony of their barren lives; and they were
sorry when the day came for their scholars to leave
them for a time. Still more did they grieve when the
inevitable day of a final departure arrived. They knew&mdash;some
by hearsay, some by experience, and some by instinct
alone&mdash;that the going away from school into the world was
the beginning of a new life, full, very often, of danger and
temptation, in which the good sisters and their teaching
were likely to be forgotten, and it was a sorrow to them to
be henceforth dissociated from the thoughts and lives of
those who had often been under their guardianship and
tuition for many years. Such a parting&mdash;probably a final
one&mdash;was now imminent, and not a few of the sisters were
troubled by the prospect, although it was against their rule
to let any sign of such grief appear.</p>

<p>It was not the hour of recreation, but the ordinary routine
of the establishment was for a little while suspended,
partly because it was holiday-time, and partly because an
unusual event was coming to pass. One of the parlor
boarders, who had been with the sisters since her childhood,
first as a boarder and then as a guest, was about to
leave them. She was to be fetched away by her mother
and her mother's father, who was an English milord, of
fabulous wealth and distinction, and, although at present a
heretic, exceedingly "well-disposed" towards the Catholic
church. It was not often that a gentleman set foot
within the precincts of the convent; and although he would
not be allowed to penetrate farther than the parlor, the
very fact of his presence sent a thrill of excitement through
the house. An English milord, a heretic, the grandfather
of "cette ch&egrave;re Lisa," whom they were to <a name="tn_12"></a><!-- TN: "loose" changed to "lose"-->lose so soon!
No wonder the most placid of the nuns, the most stolid of
the lay-sisters, tingled with excitement to the finger-tips!</p>

<p>The girl whose departure from the convent school was
thus regretted was known amongst her English friends as
Lesley Brooke. French lips, unaccustomed to a name like
Lesley, had changed it into Lisa; but Lesley loved her
own name, which was a heritage in her family, and had
been handed down to her from her grandmother. She was
always glad to hear it from friendly English lips. She was
nineteen now, and had stayed with the sisters an unusually
long time without exactly knowing why. Family circum<a name="Page_8"></a>stances,
she was told, had hitherto prevented her mother
from taking her to an English home. But now the current
of her life was to be changed. She was to leave Paris: she
was, she believed, even to leave France. Her mother had
written that she was to go to London, and that she (Lady
Alice Brooke) would come for her, in company with Lesley's
grandfather, Lord Courtleroy, with whom she had
been traveling abroad for some time past.</p>

<p>Lesley was overjoyed by the news. She had lately come
to suspect something strange, something abnormal, in her
own position. She had remained at school when other
girls went to their homes: she never had been able to answer
questions respecting her relations and their belongings.
Her mother, indeed, she knew; for she sometimes spent a
portion of the holidays with Lady Alice at a quiet watering-place
in France or Italy. And her mother was all that
could be desired. Gentle, refined, beautiful, with a slight
shade of melancholy which only made her delicate face
more attractive&mdash;at least in Lesley's eyes&mdash;Lady Alice
Brooke gained love and admiration whithersoever she
went. But she never spoke of her husband. Lesley had
gradually learned that she must not mention his name. In
her younger days she had been wont to ask questions about
her unknown father. Was he dead?&mdash;was he in another
country?&mdash;why had she never seen him? She soon found
that these questions were gently but decidedly checked.
Her mother did not decline in so many words to answer
them, but she set them aside. Only once, when Lesley
was fifteen, and made some timid, wistful reference to the
father whom she had never known, did Lady Alice make
her a formal answer.</p>

<p>"I will tell you all about your father when you are old
enough to hear," she said. "Until then, Lesley, I had
rather that you did not talk of him."</p>

<p>Lesley shrank into herself abashed, and never mentioned
his name again.</p>

<p>All the same, as she grew older, her fancy played about
this unknown father, as the fancy of young girls always
plays about a mystery. Had he committed some crime?
<a name="tn_13"></a><!-- TN: "had" changed to "Had"-->Had he disgraced himself and his family that his name
might not be breathed in Lady Alice's ear? But she could
not believe that her good, beautiful mother would ever
have loved and married a wicked man!&mdash;such was the<a name="Page_9"></a>
phrase that she, in her girlish innocence and ignorance,
used to herself. As to scandal and tittle-tattle, none of it
reached the seclusion of her convent-home, or was allowed
to sully her fair mind. And it was impossible for her to
connect the idea of folly, guilt, or shame with the pure,
sweet face of her mother, or the stately pride and dignity
of her mother's father, the Earl of Courtleroy. There was
evidently a mystery; but she was sure of one thing, that it
was a mystery without disgrace.</p>

<p>And now, as she stood waiting on the stone steps, her
face flushed a little, and her eyes filled at the thought that
she would now, perhaps, be allowed to hear the story of
her parents' lives. For she knew that she was going to
leave the convent, and it had been vaguely hinted by Lady
Alice in a recent letter that on leaving the convent Lesley
must be prepared for a great surprise.</p>

<p>Lesley looked over the silent, sweet-scented garden, and
half-sighed, half-smiled, to think that she should leave it so
soon, and perhaps for ever. But she was excited rather
than sad, and when one of the sisters appeared at the door
of the study, or <i>salle d'&eacute;tude</i>, Lesley turned towards her
with a quick, eager gesture, which not all the training to
which she had been subjected since her childhood would
have availed to suppress.</p>

<p>"Oh, sister, tell me, has she come?"</p>

<p>The sister was a tall, spare woman, with a thin face and
great dark eyes, with eyelids slightly reddened, as though
by long weeping or sleeplessness. It was an austere face,
but its severity softened into actual sweetness as she smiled
at her pupil's eagerness.</p>

<p>"Gently, my child: why so impetuous?" she said, taking
the girl's hand in her own. "Yes, madame has arrived:
she is in the parlor, speaking to the Reverend Mother; and
in five minutes you are to go to her."</p>

<p>"Not for five minutes?" said Lesley; and then, controlling
herself, she added, penitently. "I know I am
impatient, Sister Rose."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear child: you are impatient: it is in your nature,
in your blood," said the sister, looking at her with a sort
of pity in her eyes&mdash;a pity which Lesley resented, without
quite knowing why. "And you are going into a world
where you will find many things sadly different from your
expectations. If you remember the lessons that we have<a name="Page_10"></a>
tried to read you here&mdash;lessons of patience, endurance,
resignation to the will of others, and especially to the will
of God&mdash;you will be happy in spite of sorrow and tribulation."</p>

<p>The young girl trembled: it seemed as if the sister spoke
with a purpose, as if she knew of some difficulty, some
danger that lay before her. She had been trained to ask
no questions, and therefore she kept silence. But her lips
trembled, and her beautiful brown eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>"Come, my dear child," said Sister Rose, taking her by
the hand, after a short pause, "I will take you to your
mother. She will be ready for you now. May God protect
you and guide you in your way through the world!"</p>

<p>And Lesley lowered her head as if she had received a
blessing. Sister Rose was a woman whom Lesley honored
and revered, and her words, therefore, sank deep, and often
recurred to the young girl's mind in days to come.</p>

<p>They went in silence to the door of the parlor. Here
Sister Rose relinquished her pupil's hand, tapped three
times on one of the panels, and signed to Lesley to open
the door. With a trembling hand Lesley obeyed the sign;
and in another moment she was in her mother's arms.</p>

<p>Lady Alice Brooke was a very attractive looking woman.
She was tall, slight, and graceful, and although she must
have been close upon forty, she certainly had not the
appearance of a woman over four or five and thirty. Her
complexion was untouched by time: her cheeks were
smooth and fair, her blue eyes clear. Her pretty brown
hair had perhaps lost a little of the golden tinge of its
youth, but it was still soft and abundant. But the reason
why people often turned to look at her did not lie in any
measure of grace and beauty that she possessed, so much
as in an indefinable air of distinction and refinement which
seemed to pervade her whole being, and marked her off
from the rest of the world as one made of finer clay than
others.</p>

<p>Many people resented this demeanor&mdash;which was quite
unconscious on Lady Alice's part&mdash;and thought that it signified
pride, haughtiness, coldness of heart; but in all this
they were greatly, if not altogether, mistaken. Lady Alice
was not of a cold nature, and she was never willingly
haughty; but in some respects, she was what the world
calls proud. She was proud of her ancient lineage; of the<a name="Page_11"></a>
repute of her family, of the stainlessness of its name. And
she had brought up Lesley, as far as she could, in the same
old tradition.</p>

<p>Lesley was like her mother, and unlike, too. She had
her mother's tall, graceful figure; but there was much more
vivacity in her face than there had ever been in Lady
Alice's; much more warmth and life and color. There
was more determination in the lines of her mouth and chin:
her brow was broader and fuller, and her eyes were dark
brown instead of blue. But the likeness was there, with a
diversity of expression and of coloring.</p>

<p>"I thought you were never coming," said Lesley at
length, as she clung fondly to her mother. "I could hardly
sleep last night for thinking how delightful it would be to
go away with you!"</p>

<p>Lady Alice gave a little start, and looked at the girl as
if there had been some hidden meaning in her words.</p>

<p>"Go away with me?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother darling, and be with you always: to look
after you and not let grandpapa tire you with long walks
and long games of backgammon. I shall be his companion
as well as yours, and I shall take care of you both. I have
planned ever so many things that I mean to do&mdash;especially
when we go to Scotland."</p>

<p>"Lesley," said Lady Alice, faintly, "I am tired: let me
sit down." And then, as the girl made her seat herself in
the one arm-chair that the room contained, and hung over
her with affectionate solicitude, she went on, with paling
lips: "You never said these things in your letter, child!
I did not know that you were so anxious to come away&mdash;with
me."</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, dear, you surely knew it all the time?"
said Lesley, thinking the comment a reproach. "You
surely knew how I longed to be with you? But I would
not <i>say</i> much in my letters for fear of making you think I
was unhappy; and I have always been very happy here
with the dear sisters and the girls. But I thought you
<i>understood</i> me, mamma&mdash;understood by instinct, as it were,"
said Lesley, kneeling by her mother's side, and throwing an
occasional shy glance into her mother's face.</p>

<p>"I understand perfectly, dear, and I see your unselfish
motive. It makes me all the more sorry to disappoint you
as I am about to do."<a name="Page_12"></a></p>

<p>"Oh, mamma! Am I not to leave school, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, you will leave school."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and&mdash;with you?"</p>

<p>"You will come with me, certainly&mdash;until to-morrow,
darling. But you leave <i>me</i> to-morrow, too."</p>

<p>The color began to fade from Lesley's cheeks, as it had
already faded from Lady Alice's. The girl felt a great
swelling in her throat, and a film seemed to dim the clearness
of her sight. But Sister Rose's words came back to
her mind with an inspiring thrill which restored her strength.
"Patience, endurance, resignation!" Was this the occasion
on which she was to show whether these virtues were
hers or not? She would not fail in the hour of trial: she
would be patient and endure!</p>

<p>"If you will explain, mamma dear," she said, entreatingly,
"I will try to do&mdash;as you would like."</p>

<p>"My darling! My Lesley! What a help it is to me to
see you so brave!" said her mother, putting her arms
round the girl's shoulders, and resting her face on the
bright young head. "If I could keep you with me! but it
will be only for a time, my child, and then&mdash;then you <i>will</i>
come back to me?"</p>

<p>"Come back to you, mamma? As if anything would
keep me away! But what is it? where am I to go? what
am I to do? Why haven't you told me before?"</p>

<p>She was trembling with excitement. Patience was not
one of Lesley's virtues. She felt, with sudden heat of
passion, that she could bear any pain rather than this suspense,
which her mother's gentle reluctance to give pain
inflicted upon her.</p>

<p>"I did not tell you before," said Lady Alice, slowly,
"because I was under a promise not to do so. I have
been obliged to keep you in the dark about your future for
many a long year, Lesley, and the concealment has always
weighed upon my mind. You must forgive me, dearest,
for this: I did not see the consequence of my promise
when I made it first."</p>

<p>"What promise was it, mamma?"</p>

<p>"To let you leave me for a time, my dear: to let you
go from me&mdash;to let you choose your own life&mdash;oh, it seems
hard and cruel to me now."</p>

<p>"Tell me," pleaded Lesley, whose heart was by this
time beating with painful rapidity, "tell me all&mdash;quickly,
mamma, and I promise&mdash;&mdash;"<a name="Page_13"></a></p>

<p>"Promise nothing until you have heard what I have to
say," said her mother, drawing back. "I want you to
hear the story before you see your grandfather again: that
is the reason why I begged the Mother to let me speak to
you here, before you left the convent. I have been forced
into my present line of action, Lesley: I never took it wilfully.
You shall judge for yourself if it were likely that I&mdash;&mdash;But
I will not excuse myself beforehand. I can tell
you all that is necessary for you to know in very few words;
and the rest lies in your hands."</p>

<p>Lady Alice's pale lips quivered as she spoke, but her
eyes were dry and filled with a light which was singularly
cold and stern. Lesley, kneeling still, looked up into her
face, and, fascinated by what she saw there, remained motionless
and mute.</p>

<p>"I have not let you speak to me of your father," Lady
Alice began, "because I did not know how to answer your
questions truthfully. But now I must speak of him. You
have thought of him sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you have thought him dead?"</p>

<p>"I thought so&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"But he is not dead," said Lady Alice, bitterly. "To
my exceeding misfortune&mdash;and yours also&mdash;your father,
Lesley, is alive."<a name="Page_14"></a></p>

<a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a><h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">LADY ALICE'S STORY.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> girl shrank back a little, but she did not remove her
eyes from her mother's face. A great dread, however, had
entered into them. A hot color leaped into her cheeks.
Scarcely did she yet know what she dreaded; it was something
intangible, too awful to be uttered&mdash;the terror of
disgrace.</p>

<p>But Lady Alice saw the look and interpreted it aright.</p>

<p>"No, my darling," she said, "it is not <i>that</i>. It is
nothing to be ashamed of&mdash;exactly. I do not accuse your
father of any crime&mdash;unless it be a crime to have married a
woman that he did not love, and to whom he was not suited,
and to have been cruel&mdash;yes, cruel&mdash;to her and to her
child."</p>

<p>And then she burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Mamma, dear mamma!" said Lesley, clasping her and
sobbing out of sympathy, "it was a crime&mdash;worse than a
crime&mdash;to be cruel to <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>Lady Alice sobbed helplessly for a few minutes. Then
she commanded herself by a great and visible effort and
dried her eyes.</p>

<p>"It is weak to give way before you, child," she said,
sadly. "But I cannot tell you how much I have dreaded
this moment&mdash;the moment when I must tell you of the
great error of my life."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me, mamma. I would rather hear nothing
that you did not want me to know."</p>

<p>"But I must tell you, Lesley. It is in my bargain with
my husband that I should tell you. If I say nothing he
will tell you <i>his</i> side&mdash;and perhaps that would be worse."</p>

<p>Lesley kissed her mother's delicate hand. "Then&mdash;if you
<i>must</i> tell me&mdash;I should be glad to hear it all now," she
said, in a shaking voice. "Nothing seems so bad as to
know half a story&mdash;or only to guess a part&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, you have wondered why I told you nothing of
your father?"<a name="Page_15"></a></p>

<p>"I could not help wondering, mamma."</p>

<p>"Poor child! Well, whatever it costs me I will tell you
all my story now. Listen carefully, darling: I do not
want to have to tell it twice."</p>

<p>She pressed her handkerchief to her lips as if to prevent
them from trembling, and then turning her eyes to another
part of the room so that they need not rest upon her
daughter's face Lady Alice began her story.</p>

<p>"My tale is a tale of folly, not of crime," she said.
"You must remember, Lesley, that I was a motherless girl,
brought up in a lonely Scotch house in a very haphazard
way. My dear father loved me tenderly, but he was away
from home for the greater part of the year; and he understood
little of a girl's nature or a girl's requirements. When
I was sixteen he allowed me to dismiss my governess, and
to live as I liked. I was romantic and dreamy; I spent a
great deal of time in the library, and he thought that there
at least I was safe. He would have been more careful of
me, as he said afterwards, if I had wanted to roam over
the moors and fields, to fish or shoot as many modern
women do. I can only say that I think I should have been
far safer on the hillside or the moor than I was in the
lonely recesses of that library, pouring over musty volumes
of chivalry and romance.</p>

<p>"My only change was a few weeks in London with
friends, during the season. Here, young as I was, I was
thrown into a whirl of gaiety; but the society that I met
was of the best sort, and I welcomed it as a pleasant
relaxation. I saw the pleasant side of everything. You
see I was very young. I went to the most charming parties;
I was well introduced: I think I may say that I was
admired. My first season was almost the happiest&mdash;certainly
the most joyous&mdash;period of my life. But it was still
a time of unreality, Lesley: the glitter and glamour of that
glimpse of London society was as unreal as my dreams of
love and beauty and nobleness in the old library at home.
I lacked a mother's guiding hand, my child, and a mother's
tender voice to tell me what was false and what was true."</p>

<p>Involuntarily Lesley drew closer than ever to her mother.</p>

<p>The ring of pain in Lady Alice's voice saddened and even
affrighted her. It suggested a passionate yearning, an
anxiety of love, which almost overwhelmed her. It is
always alarming to a young and simple nature to be brought<a name="Page_16"></a>
suddenly into contact with a very strong emotion, either of
anguish, love, or joy.</p>

<p>"I suffered for my loss," Lady Alice went on, after a
short pause. "But at first without knowing that I suffered.
There comes a time in every woman's life, Lesley, when she
is in need of help and counsel, when, in fact, she is in
danger. As soon as a woman loves, she stands on the
brink of a precipice."</p>

<p>"I thought," murmured Lesley, "that love was the
most beautiful thing in the world?"</p>

<p>"Is that what the nuns have taught you?" asked her
mother, with a keen glance at the girl's flushing cheek.
"Well, in one sense it is true. Love is a beautiful thing to
look at&mdash;an angel to outward show&mdash;with the heart, too
often, of a fiend; and it is he who leads us to that precipice
of which I spoke&mdash;the precipice of disillusion and despair."</p>

<p>To Lesley these words were as blasphemy, for they
contradicted the whole spirit of the teaching which she had
received. But she did not dare to contradict her mother's
opinions. She looked down, and reflected dumbly that
her mother knew more about the subject than she could
possibly do. The good Sisters had talked to her about
heavenly love; she had made no fine distinctions in her
mind as to the kind of love they meant&mdash;possibly there
were two kinds. And while she was considering this
knotty point, her mother began to speak again.</p>

<p>"I was between eighteen and nineteen," said Lady Alice,
"scarcely as old as you are now, when a new interest came
into my life. My father gave permission to a young literary
man to examine our archives, which contained much of
historical value. He never thought of cautioning me to
leave the library to Mr. Brooke's sole occupation. I was
accustomed to spend much of my time there: and the
stranger&mdash;Mr. Brooke&mdash;must have heard this fact from the
servants, for he begged that he might not disturb me, and
that I would frequent the library as usual. After a little
hesitation, I began to do so. My father was in London,
and my only chaperon was an old lady who was too infirm
to be of much use. Before long, I began to help Mr.
Brooke in his researches and inquiries. He was writing a
book on the great Scottish families of that part of the
country, and the subject interested me. Need I tell you<a name="Page_17"></a>
what followed, Lesley? Need I explain to you the heedless
selfish folly of that time? I forgot my duty to my father,
my duty to myself. I fancied I loved this man, and I
promised to marry him."</p>

<p>There was <a name="tn_22"></a><!--TN: "a a" changed to "a"-->a light of interest in Lesley's eyes. She
did not altogether understand her mother's tone. It
sounded as though Lady Alice condemned lovers and all
their ways, and such condemnation puzzled the girl, in
spite of her convent breeding. During the last few months
she had been allowed a much wider range of literature
than was usual in the Sisters' domain; her mother had
requested that she should be supplied with certain volumes
of history, fiction, and poetry, that had considerably
enlarged Lesley's views of life; and yet Lady Alice's words
seemed to contradict all that the girl had previously heard
or read of love. The mother read the unspoken question
in Lesley's eyes, and answered it in a somewhat modified
tone.</p>

<p>"My dear, I do not mean that I think it wrong to love.
So long as the world lasts I suppose people will love&mdash;and
be miserable. It is right enough, if it is opposed by no
other law. But in my case, I was wrong from beginning
to end. I knew that my father would never give his permission
to my marriage with Mr. Brooke; and, in my
youthful folly, I thought that my best plan was to take my
own way. I married Mr. Brooke in private, and then I
went away with him to London. And it was not long,
Lesley, before I rued my disobedience and my deceit. It
was a great mistake."</p>

<p>"But mamma, why were you so sure that grandpapa
would not give his consent?"</p>

<p>Lady Alice opened her gentle eyes with a look of profound
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Darling, don't you see? Mr. Brooke was&mdash;nobody."</p>

<p>"But if you loved him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Lesley, your grandfather would never have heard
of such a marriage. He had his own plans for me. My
dear, I am not saying a word against your father in saying
this. I am only telling you the fact&mdash;that he was what is
often called a self-made, self-educated man, who could not
possibly be styled my equal in the eyes of society. His
father had been a small tradesman in Devonshire. The son
being clever and&mdash;and&mdash;handsome, made his way a little<a name="Page_18"></a>
in the world. He became a journalist: he wrote for magazines
and newspapers and reviews: he was what is called
a literary hack. He had no certain prospects, no certain
income, when he married me. I think," said Lady Alice,
with a sort of cold scorn, which was intensified by the very
softness of her tones, "that he could not have done a more
unjustifiable thing than persuade a girl in my position to
marry him."</p>

<p>Lesley felt a slight diminution of sympathy with her
mother. Perhaps Lady Alice was conscious of some
change in her face, for she added hastily.</p>

<p>"Don't misjudge me, Lesley. If there had been between
us the strong and tender love of which women too often
dream, poverty might perhaps have been forgotten. It
sounds terribly worldly to draw attention to the fact that
poverty is apt to kill a love which was not very strong at
the beginning. But the fact was that neither Caspar
Brooke nor I knew our own minds. He was three-and-twenty
and I was eighteen. We married in haste, and we
certainly repented very much at leisure."</p>

<p>"Was he not&mdash;kind?" asked Lesley, timidly.</p>

<p>"Kind?" said her mother, with a sigh. "Oh, yes,
perhaps he was kind&mdash;at first. Until he was tired of me,
or I was tired of him. I don't know on which side the
disillusion was felt first. Think where I came from&mdash;from
the dear old Castle, the moors, the lochs, the free fresh air
of Scotland, to a dreary lodging of two little rooms in a
dingy street, where I had to cut and contrive and economize
to make ends meet. I was an ignorant girl, and I
could not do it. I got into debt, and my husband was
angry with me. Why should I tell you the petty, sordid
details of my life? I soon found out that I was miserable
and that he was miserable too."</p>

<p>Lesley listened breathlessly with hidden face. The story
was full of humiliation for her. It seemed like a desecration
of all that she had hitherto held dear.</p>

<p>"My father and my friends would not forgive me," Lady
Alice went on. "In our direst straits of poverty, I am
glad to say that I never appealed to them. We struggled
on together&mdash;your father and I&mdash;until you were four years
old. Then a change came&mdash;a change which made it
impossible for me to bear the misery of my life. Your
father&mdash;&mdash;"<a name="Page_19"></a></p>

<p>She came to a sudden stop, and sat with eyes fixed on
the opposite wall, a curious expression of mingled desolation
and contempt upon her cold, clear-cut face. For some
reason or other Lesley felt afraid to hear what her mother
had to say.</p>

<p>"Mamma, don't tell me! Don't look like that," she
cried. "I can't bear to hear it! Why need you tell me any
more?"</p>

<p>"Because," said her mother, slowly, "because your
father exacts this sacrifice from me: that I should tell you&mdash;<i>you</i>,
my daughter&mdash;the reason why I left him. I promised
that I would do so, and I will keep my promise.
The thing that hurts me most, Lesley, is to think that I
may be injuring you&mdash;staining your innocence&mdash;darkening
your youth&mdash;by telling you what I have to tell. At your
age, I would rather that you knew nothing of life but its
brighter side&mdash;nothing of love but what was fair and sweet.
But it is the punishment of my first false step that I
should bring sorrow upon my child. Lesley, in years to
come remember that I have warned you to be honest and
true, unless you would make those miserable whom you
love best. If I had never deceived my father, my husband
would never perhaps have deceived me; and I should not
have to tell my child that the last person in the world whom
she must trust is her father."</p>

<p>There was a little silence, and then she continued in a
strained and unnatural tone.</p>

<p>"There was a woman&mdash;another woman&mdash;whom he loved.
That is all."</p>

<p>Lesley shivered and hid her face. To her mind, young
and innocent as it was, the fact which her mother stated
seemed like an indelible stain. She hardly dared as yet
think what it meant. And, after a long pause, Lady Alice
went on quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not want to exaggerate. I do not believe that he
meant to leave me&mdash;even to be untrue to me. I could not
speak to you of him if I thought him so black-hearted, so
treacherous. I mean simply this&mdash;take the fact as I state
it, and inquire no further; I found that my husband cared
for some one else more than he cared for me. My resolution
was taken at once: I packed up my things, left his
house, and threw myself at my father's feet. He was good
to me and forgave me, and since then ... I have never
entered my husband's house again."<a name="Page_20"></a></p>

<p>"He must have been wicked&mdash;wicked!" said Lesley, in
a strangled voice.</p>

<p>"No, he was not wicked. Let me do him so much
justice. He was upright on the whole, I believe. He
never meant to give me cause for complaint. But I had
reason to believe that another woman suited him better
than I did ... and it was only fair to leave him."</p>

<p>"But did he&mdash;could he&mdash;marry her? I <a name="tn_25"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "mean&mdash;&mdash;"-->mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My poor Lesley, you are very ignorant," said Lady
Alice, smiling a wan smile, and touching the girl's cheek
lightly with her hand. "How could he marry another
woman when I was alive? Your father and I separated
on account of what is called incompatibility of temper.
The question of the person whom he apparently preferred
to me never arose between us."</p>

<p>"Then, is it not possible, mamma, that you may have
been mistaken?" said Lesley, impetuously.</p>

<p>Lady Alice shook her head. "Quite impossible, Lesley.
I accuse your father of nothing. I only mean that another
woman&mdash;one of his friends&mdash;would have suited him better
than I, and that he knew it. I have no cause for complaint
against him. And I would not have told you <i>this</i>, had I not
felt it a duty to put in the strongest possible light my reasons
for leaving him, so that a day may never come when
you turn round upon me and blame me&mdash;as others have
done&mdash;for fickleness, for ill-temper, for impatience with my
husband; because now you know&mdash;as no one else knows&mdash;the
whole truth."</p>

<p>"But I should never blame you, mamma."</p>

<p>"I do not know. I know this&mdash;that your father is a
man who can persuade and argue and represent his conduct
in any light that suits his purpose. He is a very
eloquent&mdash;a very plausible man. He will try to win you
over to his side."</p>

<p>"But I shall never see him."</p>

<p>"Yes, Lesley, you will. You are going to him to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I will not&mdash;I will not"&mdash;said the girl, springing from
her knees, and involuntarily clenching her right hand. "I
will not speak to him&mdash;if he treated my darling mother so
shamefully he must be bad, and I will not acknowledge
any relationship to him."</p>

<p>A look of apprehension showed itself in Lady Alice's
eyes.<a name="Page_21"></a></p>

<p>"Darling," she said, "you must not let your generous
love for me run away with your judgment. I am bound,
and you must be bound with me. Listen, when your
father found that I had left him he was exceedingly
angry. He came to your grandfather's house, he
clamored to see me, he attempted to justify himself&mdash;oh,
I cannot tell you the misery that I went through. At last
I consented to see him. He behaved like a madman.
He swore that he would have me back&mdash;tyrant that he
was!"</p>

<p>"Mamma&mdash;perhaps he cared?"</p>

<p>"Cared! He cared for his reputation," said Lady Alice
growing rather white about the lips. "For nothing else!
Not for me, Lesley! When his violence had expended
itself we came to terms. He agreed to let me live where
I liked on condition that when you were eight years old
you were sent to school, and saw me only during the
holidays&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"He said that he dreaded my influence on your mind,"
said Lady Alice. "That you should be brought up at a
good school was the first thing. Secondly, that when you
were nineteen you should spend a year with him, and then
a year with me; and that when you were twenty-one you
should choose for yourself with which of the two you preferred
to cast in your lot."</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, I cannot go to him now."</p>

<p>"You must go, Lesley. I am bound, and you are bound
by my promise. Only for a year, my darling. Then you
can come back to me for ever. I stipulated that I should
see you first, and say to you what I chose."</p>

<p>"But cannot I wait a little while?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-four hours, Lesley; that is all. You go to
your father to-morrow."<a name="Page_22"></a></p>

<p class="chapterhead">MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> conversation between Lesley and her mother occupied
a considerable time, and the sun was sinking westward
when at last the two ladies left the Convent. Lesley's
adieux had been made before Lady Alice's arrival, and
the only persons whom she saw, therefore, after the long
interview with her mother, were the Mother Superior, and
the Sister who had summoned her to the parlor.</p>

<p>While Lady Alice and the Reverend Mother exchanged
a few last words, Lesley drew close to Sister Rose's side,
and laid her hand on the serge-covered arm.</p>

<p>"You were right," she said. "Sister, I see already
that I shall need patience and endurance where I am
going."</p>

<p>"Gentleness and love, also," said the Sister. Then, as
if in answer to an indefinable change in Lesley's lips and
eyes, she added gently, "We are told that peacemakers
are blessed."</p>

<p>"I could not make peace&mdash;&mdash;" Lesley began, hastily,
and then she stopped short, confused, not knowing how
much Sister Rose had heard of her mother's story. But
if Sister Rose were ignorant of it, her next words were
singularly appropriate. For she said, in a low tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"Peace is better than war: forgiveness better than
hatred. Dear child, it may be in your hands to reconcile
those who have been long divided. Do your best."</p>

<p>Lesley had no time to reply.</p>

<p>It was a long drive from the Convent of the Annonciades
to the hotel where Lord Courtleroy and Lady Alice
were staying. The mother and daughter spoke little; each
seemed wrapped in her own reflections. There were a
hundred questions which Lesley was longing to ask; but
she did not like to disturb her mother's silence. Dusk had
fallen before their destination was reached; and Lesley's
thoughts were diverted a little from their sad bewilderment
by what was to her the novel sight of Paris by gaslight,<a name="Page_23"></a>
and the ever-flowing, opposing currents of human beings
that filled the streets. Hitherto, when she had left the
Sisters for her holidays, her mother had wisely kept her
within certain bounds: she had not gone out of doors after
dark, she had not seen anything but the quieter sides of
life. But now all seemed to be changed. Her mother
mentioned the name of the best hotel in Paris as their
destination: she said a few words about shopping, dresses,
and jewellery, which made Lesley's heart beat faster, in
spite of a conviction that it was very mean and base to
feel any joy in such trivial matters. Especially under
present circumstances. But she was young and full of life;
and there certainly was some excitement in the prospect
before her.</p>

<p>"I shall not need much where I am going, shall I?" she
hazarded timidly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, but you must not be in any difficulty.
There is not time to do a great deal, but you can be fitted
and have some dresses sent after you, and I can choose
your hats. And a fur-lined cloak for travelling&mdash;you will
want that. We must do what we can in the time. It is
not likely that your father sees much society."</p>

<p>"It will be very lonely," said Lesley, with a little gasp.</p>

<p>"My poor child! I am afraid it will. I can tell some
friends of mine to call on you; but I don't know whether
they will be admitted."</p>

<p>"Where is&mdash;the house?" Lesley asked. She did not
like to say "my father's house."</p>

<p>"In Upper Woburn Place, Bloomsbury. I believe it is
near Euston Square, or some such neighborhood."</p>

<p>"Then it is not where <i>you</i> lived, mamma?"</p>

<p>"No, dear. We lived further West, in a street near
Portman Square. I believe that Mr. Brooke finds Bloomsbury
a convenient district for the kind of work that he has
to do."</p>

<p>She spoke very formally of her husband; but Lesley
began to notice an under-current of resentment, of something
like contempt, in her voice when she spoke of him.
Lady Alice tried in vain to simulate an indifference which
she did not feel, and the very effort roughened her voice
and sharpened her accent in a way of which she was
unconscious. The effect on a young girl, who had not
seen much of human emotion, was to induce a passing<a name="Page_24"></a>
doubt of her mother's judgment, and a transient wonder
as to whether her father had always been so much in the
wrong. The sensation was but momentary, for Lesley was
devotedly attached to her mother, and could not believe
her to be mistaken. And, while she was repenting of her
hasty injustice, the carriage stopped between the white
globes of electric light that fronted a great hotel, and Lesley
was obliged to give her attention to the things around her
rather than to her own thoughts and feelings.</p>

<p>A waiter conducted the mother and daughter up one
flight of stairs and consigned them to the care of a chambermaid.
The chambermaid led them to the door of a suite
of rooms, where they were met by Dayman, Lady Alice's
own woman, whose stolid face relaxed into a smile of
pleasure at the sight of Lesley.</p>

<p>"Take Miss Brooke to her own room and see that she
is made nice for dinner," said her mistress. "His Lordship
has ordered dinner in our own rooms, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lady. Covers for four&mdash;Captain Duchesne is
here."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Lady Alice, with an accent of faint surprise,
"oh&mdash;well&mdash;Lesley, dear, we must not be late."</p>

<p>To Lesley it seemed hardly worth while to unpack her
boxes and dress herself for that one evening in the soft
embroidered white muslin which had hitherto served for
her best Sunday frock. But Mrs. Dayman insisted on a
careful toilette, and was well satisfied with the result.</p>

<p>"There, Miss Lesley," she said, "you have just your
mamma's look&mdash;a sort of finished look, as if you were
perfect outside and in!"</p>

<p>Lesley laughed. "That compliment might be taken in
two ways, Dayman," she said, as she turned to meet her
mother at the door. And in a few minutes she was standing
in the gay little French <i>salon</i>, where the earl was conversing
with a much younger man in a glare of waxlights.</p>

<p>Lord Courtleroy was a stately-looking man, with perfectly
<a name="tn_29"></a><!-- TN: "show-white" changed to "snow-white"-->snow-white hair and beard, an upright carriage, and
bright, piercing, blue eyes. A striking man in appearance,
and of exceedingly well-marked characteristics. The
family pride for which he had long been noted seemed to
show itself in his bearing and in every feature as he greeted
his granddaughter, and yet it was softened by a touch of
personal affection with which family pride had nothing<a name="Page_25"></a>
whatever to do. For Lord Courtleroy's feelings towards
Lesley were mixed. He saw in her the child of a man
whose very name he detested, who stood as a type to him
of all that was hateful in the bourgeois class. But he also
saw in her his own granddaughter, "poor Alice's girl,"
whom fate had used so unkindly in giving her Caspar
Brooke for a father. The earl had next to no personal
knowledge of Caspar Brooke. They had not met since
the one sad and stormy interview which they had held
together when Lady Alice had left her husband's house.
And Lord Courtleroy was wont to declare that he did not
wish to know anything more of Mr. Brooke. That he was
a Radical journalist, and that he had treated a daughter of
the Courtleroys with shameful unkindness and neglect,
was quite enough for the earl. And his manner to Lesley
varied a little according as his sense of her affinity with
his own family or his remembrance of her kinship with
Mr. Brooke was uppermost.</p>

<p>Lesley was too simply filial in disposition to resent or
even to remark on his changes of mood. She admired her
grandfather immensely, and was pleased to hear him comment
on her growth and development since she saw him
last. And then the visitor was introduced to her; and to
Lesley's interest and surprise she saw that he was young.</p>

<p>Young men were an unknown quantity to Lesley. She
could not remember that she had ever spoken to a man so
young and so good-looking before! Captain Henry
Duchesne was tall, well-made, well-dressed: he was very
dark in complexion, and had a rather heavy jaw; but his
dark eyes were pleasant and honest, and he had a very
attractive smile. The length of his moustache was almost
the first thing that struck Lesley: it seemed to her so
abnormally lengthy, with such very stiffly waxed ends, that
she could scarcely avert her eyes from them. She was
not able to tell, save from instinct, whether a man were
well or ill-dressed, but she felt sure that Captain Duchesne's
air of smartness was due to the perfection of every detail
of his attire. She liked his manner: it was easy, well-bred,
and unassuming; and she felt glad that he was
present. For after the communication made to her by her
mother, the evening might have proved an occasion of
embarrassment. It was a relief to talk to some one for a
little while who did not know her present circumstances
and position.<a name="Page_26"></a></p>

<p>Lady Alice watched the two young people with a little
dawning trouble in her sad eyes. She had known and
liked Harry Duchesne since his childhood, and she had
not been free from certain hopes and visions of his future,
which affected Lesley also, but she thought that her father's
invitation had been premature. Especially when she heard
Captain Duchesne say to the girl in the course of the
evening&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you going to London to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe so," said Lesley, looking down.</p>

<p>"And you will be in town during the winter, I hope?"</p>

<p>Lady Alice thought it well to interpose.</p>

<p>"My daughter will not be staying with me. She goes
to a relation's house for a few months, and will lead a very
quiet life indeed. When she comes back to Courtleroy it
will be time enough for her to commence a round of
gaieties." This with a smile; but, as Henry Duchesne
knew well enough, with Lady Alice a smile sometimes
covered a very serious purpose. His quick perceptions
showed him that he was not wanted to call on Miss Brooke
during her stay in London, and he adroitly changed the
subject.</p>

<p>"Unfashionable relations, I suppose," he said to himself,
reflecting on the matter at a later hour of the evening.
"Upon my word I shouldn't have thought that Lady Alice
was so worldly-minded! She certainly didn't want me to
know where Miss Brooke was going. To some relation
of that disreputable father of hers, I should fancy. Poor
girt!"</p>

<p>For, like many other persons in London society, Captain
Duchesne knew only the name and nothing of the character
of the man whom Lady Alice had married and left. It
was vaguely supposed that he was not a very respectable
character, and that no woman of spirit would have submitted
to live with him any longer. Lady Alice's reputation
stood so high that it could not be supposed that any
one except her husband was in fault. Brooke is not an
uncommon name. In certain circles the name of Caspar
Brooke was known well enough; but was not often identified
with the man who had run away with an earl's
daughter. He had other claims to repute, but in a world
to which Lady Alice had not the right of entry.</p>

<p>When Harry Duchesne had departed Lady Alice went
with Lesley to her bedroom. Mother and daughter sat<a name="Page_27"></a>
down together, clasping each other's hands, and looking
wistfully from time to time into each other's faces, but
saying very little. The wish to ask questions faded out of
Lesley's mind. She could not ask more than her mother
chose to tell her.</p>

<p>But Lady Alice thought that she had already said too
much, and she restrained her tongue. It was after a long
and pregnant silence that she murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lesley, my child, I want you to promise me something."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, mamma!"</p>

<p>"I feel like one who is sending a lamb forth into the
midst of wolves. Not that Mr. Brooke is a wolf&mdash;exactly,"
said Lady Alice, with a forced laugh, "but I mean that
you are young and&mdash;and&mdash;unsophisticated, and that there
may be a mixture of people at his house."</p>

<p>Lesley was silent; she did not quite know what "a
mixture of people" would be like.</p>

<p>"I am so afraid for you, darling," said her mother,
pleadingly. "Afraid lest you should be drawn into
relationships and connections that you might afterwards
regret: Do you understand me? Will you promise me
to make no vows of any sort while you are away from me?
Only for one year, my child&mdash;promise me for the year."</p>

<p>"I don't think I quite understand you, mamma."</p>

<p>"Must I put it so plainly? I mean this, Lesley. Don't
engage yourself to be married while you are in your father's
house."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is easily promised!" said Lesley, with a smile
of frank amusement and relief.</p>

<p>"It may not be so easy to carry out as you think. Give
me your word, darling. You promise not to form any
engagement of marriage for a year? You promise me
that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, mamma, I promise," said the girl, so lightly
that Lady Alice almost felt that she had done an unwarrantable
thing in exacting a promise only half understood.
But she swallowed her rising qualms, and went oh, as if
exculpating herself&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a safeguard. I do not ask you to marry only a
man that I approve&mdash;I simply ask you to wait until I can
help you with my advice. It will be no loss to you in any
way. You are too young to think of these things yet;<a name="Page_28"></a>
but it is on the young that unscrupulous persons love to
prey&mdash;and therefore I give you a warning."</p>

<p>"I am quite sure that I shall not need it," said Lesley,
confidently; "and if I did, I could write and ask your
advice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no! Oh, how could I forget to tell you? You
are not to write to me while you are in your father's house."</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, that is cruel."</p>

<p>"It is <i>his</i> doing, not mine. Intercede with <i>him</i>, if you
like. That was one of the conditions&mdash;that for this one
year you should have no intercourse with me. And for
the next year you will have no intercourse with him. And
after that, you may choose for yourself."</p>

<p>But this deprivation of correspondence affected Lesley
more powerfully than even the prospect of separation&mdash;to
which she was used already. She threw herself into her
mother's arms and wept bitterly for a few moments. Then
it occurred to her that she was acting neither thoughtfully
nor courageously, and that her grief would only grieve her
mother, and could remedy nothing. So she sat up and
dried her eyes, and tried to respond cheerfully when Lady
Alice spoke a few soothing words. But in the whole course
of her short life poor Lesley had never been so miserable
as she was that night.</p>

<p>The bustle of preparation which had to be gone through
next day prevented her, however, from thinking too much
about her troubles. She and Lady Alice, with the faithful
Dayman, were to leave Paris late in the afternoon; and
the morning was spent in hurried excursions to shops,
interviews with milliners and dressmakers, eager discussions
on color, shape, and fitness. Lesley was glad to see
that she was not to be sent to London with anything over-fine
in the way of clothes. The gowns chosen were
extremely simple, but in good taste; and the <i>modiste</i>
promised that they should be sent after the young lady in
the course of a very few days. There was some argument
as to whether Lesley would require a ball dress, or dinner
dresses. Lady Alice thought not. But, although nothing
that could actually be called a ball-dress was ordered, there
were one or two frocks of lovely shimmering hue and
delightfully soft texture which would serve for any such
festivity.<a name="Page_29"></a></p>

<p>"Though in <i>my</i> day," said Lady Alice, smiling, "we
did not go to balls in Bloomsbury. But, of course, I don't
know what society Mr. Brooke sees now."</p>

<p>Lesley was conscious of the sarcasm.</p>

<p>The earl remained in Paris, while Lady Alice went with
her daughter from Havre to Southampton, and thence to
London. Dayman travelled with them; and a supplementary
escort appeared in the person of Captain Duchesne,
who "happened to be travelling that way." Lady Alice
was not displeased to see him, although she had a guilty
sense of stealing a march upon her husband in providing
Lesley with a standard of youthful good-breeding and
good-looks. It might tend to preserve her from forming
any silly attachment in her father's circle, Lady Alice
thought. As a matter of fact, she was singularly ignorant
of what that circle might comprise. She had left him
before his more prosperous days began to dawn, and
she continued therefore to picture him to herself as the
struggling journalist in murky lodgings&mdash;"the melancholy
literary man" who smoked strong tobacco far into the
night, and talked of things in which she had no interest at
all. If matters were changed with Caspar Brooke since
then, Lady Alice did not know it.</p>

<p>She had ascertained that Mr. Brooke's sister was living
in his house, and that she was capable of acting in some
sort as Lesley's chaperon. Then, a connection of the
earl's was rector of a neighboring church close to Upper
Woburn Place&mdash;and he had promised to take Miss Brooke
under his especial pastoral care;&mdash;although, as he mildly
insinuated, he was not in the habit of visiting at Number
Fifty. And with these recommendations and assurances,
Lady Alice was forced to be content.</p>

<p>She parted from her daughter at Waterloo Station. It
did not seem possible to her to drive up to her husband's
house in a cab, and drive away again. She committed her,
therefore, to the care of Dayman, and put the girl and her
maid into a four-wheeler, with Lesley's luggage on the top.
Then she established herself in the ladies' waiting-room,
until such time as Dayman should return.</p>

<p>With beating heart and flushing cheek Lesley drove
through the rapidly-darkening streets to her father's house.
She was terribly nervous at the prospect of meeting him.<a name="Page_30"></a>
And, even after the history that she had learnt from her
mother, she felt that she had not the slightest notion as to
what manner of man Caspar Brooke might turn out to be.<a name="Page_31"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">THE MANNER OF MAN.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">On</span> the day preceding Lesley Brooke's arrival in London,
a tall, broad-shouldered man was walking along Southampton
Row. He was a big man&mdash;a man whom people
turned to look at&mdash;a distinctly noticeable man. He was
considerably taller and broader than the average of his
fellows: he was wide-chested and muscular, though without
any inclination to stoutness; and he had a handsome,
sunburned face, with a short brown beard and deep-set,
dark-brown eyes. His hair was not cut quite to the conventional
shortness, perhaps: there was a lock that would
fall in an unruly manner across the broad brow with an
obstinacy no hairdresser could subvert. But, in all other
respects, he was very much as other men: he dressed well,
if rather carelessly, and presented to the world a somewhat
imposing personality. He did not wear gloves, and he had
no flower at his button-hole; but the respectability of his
silk hat and well-made coat was unimpeachable, and he had
all the air of easy command which is so characteristic of the
well-bred Englishman. The slight roughness about him
was as inseparable from his build and his character as it is
to the best-groomed and best-bred staghound or mastiff of
the highest race.</p>

<p>Southampton Row, as is well known, leads into Russell
Square. In fact the straight line of the Row merges imperceptibly
into one side of the Square, whence it continues
under the name of Woburn Place, the East side of Tavistock
Square, Upper Woburn Place, and Euston Square,
losing itself at last in the Northern wilderness of the
crowded Euston Road. It was at a house which he
passed in his straight course from Holburn towards St.
Pancras that this very tall and strong-looking gentleman
stopped, at about five o'clock on a September afternoon.</p>

<p>He stood on the steps for a moment, and looked up and
down the house doubtfully, as if seeking for signs of life<a name="Page_32"></a>
from within. A great many people were still out of town,
and he was uncertain whether the occupants of this house
were at home or not. The place had evidently been in
the hands of painters and cleaners since he saw it last:
the stone-work was scrupulously white, the wood-work
was painted a delicate green. The visitor lifted his well-defined
eyebrows at the lightness of the color, as he turned
to the door and rang the bell. It was easy to see that he
was an observant man, upon whose eyes very few things
were lost.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Romaine in?" he asked the trim maid who appeared
in answer to his ring. He noticed that she was a
new maid.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. What name shall I say, please, sir?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Brooke."</p>

<p>The girl looked intelligent, as if she had heard the name
before. And Mr. Brooke, following her upstairs to the
drawing-room, reflected on the quickness with which servants
make themselves acquainted with their masters' and
mistresses' affairs, and the disadvantages of a civilization
in which you were at the mercy of your servants' tongues.</p>

<p>These reflections had no bearing on his own circumstances:
they proceeded entirely from Mr. Brooke's habit of
taking general views, and making large applications of
small things.</p>

<p>The day was cloudy, and, although it was only five
o'clock, the streets were growing dark. The weather was
chilly, moreover, and the wind blew from the East. It
was a pleasant change to enter Mrs. Romaine's drawing-room,
which was full of soft light from a glowing little
fire, full of the scent of roses and the lovely tints of Indian
embroideries, Italian tapestries, dead gold-leaf backgrounds,
and china that was beautiful as well as rare.
Lady Alice Brooke, in her narrow isolation from the world,
would not have believed that so charming a room could be
found east of Great Portland Street. In which opinion
she was very much mistaken; for her belief that in
"society" and society's haunts alone could one find taste,
culture, and beauty, led her to ignore the vast number of
intellectual and artistic folk who still sojourn in the dim
squares of Bloomsbury and Regent's Park. Sooth to say
Lady Alice knew absolutely nothing of the worlds of intellect
and art, save by means of an occasional article in the<a name="Page_33"></a>
magazines, or a stroll through the large picture galleries of
London during the season. She was a good woman in her
way, and&mdash;also in her way&mdash;a clever one; but she had
been brought up in another atmosphere from that which her
husband loved, elevated in a totally different school, and
she was not of a nature to adapt herself to what she did
not thoroughly understand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine knew well enough that she was quite as
well able to hold her own in the fashionable world if once
she obtained an entrance to it as any Lady Alice or Lady
Anybody of her acquaintance. But then the difficulty of
entering if was very great. She had not sufficient fortune
to vie with women who every year spent hundreds on their
dress and on their dinner. She was handsome, but she
was middle-aged. She had few friends of sufficient distinction
to push her forward. And she was a wise woman.
She thought it better to live where she enjoyed a good
deal of popularity and consideration; where she could entertain
in a modest way, where her husband had been well
known, and she could glow with the reflected light that
came to her from his shining abilities. These reasons were
patent to the world: she really made no secret of them.
But there was another reason, not quite so patent to the
world, for her living quietly in Russell Square, and this
reason she kept strictly to herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine had been a widow for three years. Her
husband had been a very learned man&mdash;Professor of numerous
Oriental languages at University College for some
years, afterwards a Judge in Calcutta; and as he had
always lived in the West Central district during his Professorate,
Mrs. Romaine declared that she loved it and
could live nowhere else. The house in Russell Square
was only partly hers. Her brother rented some of the
rooms (shared the house with her, as Mrs. Romaine
vaguely phrased it), and lightened the expense. But the
two drawing-rooms, opening out of one another, were
entirely at Mrs. Romaine's disposal, and she was generally
to be found there between four and five o'clock in an afternoon&mdash;a
fact of which it is to be presumed that Mr. Brooke
was aware.</p>

<p>"So you have come back to town?" she said, rising to
meet him, and extending both hands with a pretty air of
appropriative friendship.<a name="Page_34"></a></p>

<p>"Yes; but I hardly expected to find you here so
early."</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine shrugged her shoulders a little.</p>

<p>"I found the country very dull," she said. "And
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I went to Norway. I was well enough off. I
rather enjoyed myself. Perhaps I required a little bracing
up for the task that lies before me." He laughed as he
spoke.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine paused for a moment in her task of pouring
out the tea.</p>

<p>"You are resolved, then, to assume that responsibility?"
she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"My dear Rosalind! it's in the bond," answered Caspar
Brooke, very coolly.</p>

<p>He took the cup from her hand, stirred its contents,
and proceeded to drink them in a leisurely manner,
glancing at his hostess meanwhile, with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine's dark eyes dropped before that glance.
There was an inscrutable look upon her face, but it was a
look that would have told another woman that Mrs. Romaine
was disappointed by the news which she had just
heard. Caspar Brooke, being a man, saw nothing.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," Mrs. Romaine said presently, with an assumption
of great candor. "I am afraid you will have an
uncomfortable time."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he answered, with indifference. "I shall not
be uncomfortable, because it will not affect me in the least.
When I spoke of bracing myself for the task, I was in jest."
Mrs. Romaine did not believe this statement. "I shall go
my own way whether the girl is in the house or not."</p>

<p>"Why, then, did you insist on this arrangement?"</p>

<p>"It is only right to give the girl a chance," said Mr.
Brooke. "If she has any grit in her the next twelve
months will bring it out. Besides, it is simple justice. She
ought to see and judge for herself. If she decides&mdash;as her
mother did&mdash;that I am an ogre, she can go back to her
aristocratic friends in the North. I shall not try to keep
her." There was the suspicion of a grim sneer on his face
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Do you know what she is like?"</p>

<p>"Yes: I saw her one day in Paris. She did not know,
of course, that I was watching her. She is like her
mother."<a name="Page_35"></a></p>

<p>The tone was unpromising. But perhaps it would have
been as well if Rosalind Romaine had not murmured so
pityingly&mdash;</p>

<p>"My poor friend! What you have suffered&mdash;and oh,
what you <i>will</i> suffer!"</p>

<p>Brooke looked at her in silence, and his eyes softened.
Mrs. Romaine seemed to him at that moment the incarnation
of all that was sweet and womanly. She was slender,
pale, graceful: she had velvety dark eyes and picturesque
curling hair, cut short like a Florentine boy's. Her dress
was harmonious in color and design; her attitude was
charming, her voice most musical. It crossed Mr.
Brooke's mind, as it had crossed his mind before, that he
might have been very happy if Providence had sent him a
wife like Rosalind Romaine.</p>

<p>"I shall not suffer," he said, after a little silence,
"because I will not suffer. My daughter will live for a
year in my house, but she will not trouble my peace, I can
assure you. She will go her own way, and I shall go
mine."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that she will not be so passive as you
think," said Mrs. Romaine, with some hesitation. "She
has been brought up in a very different school from any
that you would recommend. A girl fresh from a French
convent is not an easy person to deal with. Whatever
may be the advantages of these convents, there are certain
virtues which are not inculcated in them."</p>

<p>"Such as&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Truth and honesty, Caspar, my friend. Your daughter's
accomplishments will not include candor, I fear."</p>

<p>Mr. Brooke was silent for a moment, his face expressing
more concern than he knew. Mrs. Romaine watched him
furtively.</p>

<p>"It may be so," he said at last in a rather heavy tone,
"but it can't be helped. I had no hand in choosing a
school for her, Rosalind"&mdash;his voice took a pleading tone
"you will do your best for her? You will be her friend
in spite of defects in her training?"</p>

<p>"I will do anything that I can. But you will forgive me
for saying, Caspar, that it is hard for me to forget that she
is the daughter of the woman who&mdash;practically&mdash;wrecked
your life."</p>

<p>Brooke's face grew hard again. He uttered a short
laugh, which had not a very agreeable sound.<a name="Page_36"></a></p>

<p>"Wrecked my life!" he repeated, disdainfully.
"Excuse me, Rosalind. No woman ever had the power
of wrecking my life. Indeed, I have been far more fortunate
and prosperous since Lady Alice chose to leave me
than before."</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine said nothing. She was an adept in the
art of insinuating by a look, a turn of the head, a gesture,
what she wished to convey. At this moment she indicated
very clearly, though without speaking a word, that
she sympathized deeply with her friend, Caspar Brooke,
and was exceedingly indignant at the way in which he had
been treated.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mr. Brooke found the atmosphere enervating,
for with a half smile and shake of the head, he rose up to
go. Mrs. Romaine rose also.</p>

<p>"She comes to-morrow evening," he said, before he took
his leave.</p>

<p>"To-morrow evening? You will be out!"</p>

<p>"No, it is Wednesday: I can manage an evening at
home. Perhaps you will kindly look in on Thursday afternoon?"</p>

<p>And this Mrs. Romaine undertook to do.</p>

<p>Caspar Brooke continued his walk along the Eastern
side of Russell Square and Woburn Place. His quick
observant eyes took note of every incident in his way, of
every man, woman, and child within their range of vision.
He stopped once to rate a cabman, not too mildly, for
beating an over-worked horse&mdash;took down his number, and
threatened to prosecute him for cruelty to animals. A
ragged boy who asked him for money was brought to a
standstill by some keenly-worded questions respecting his
home, his name, his father's occupation, and the school
which he attended. Of these Mr. Brooke also made a note,
much to the boy's dismay; but consolation followed in the
shape of a shilling, although the donor muttered a malediction
on his own folly as he turned away. His last actions,
before reaching his own house in Upper Woburn Place,
were&mdash;first to ring the area-bell for a dog that was waiting
at another man's gate (an office which the charitable are
often called upon to perform in the streets of London for
dogs and cats alike), and then to pick up a bony black
kitten and take it on his arm to his own door, where he
delivered it to a servant, with injunctions to feed and<a name="Page_37"></a>
comfort the starveling. From which facts it may be seen
that Mr. Caspar Brooke, in spite of all his faults, was a
lover of dumb animals, and of children, and must therefore
have possessed a certain amount of kindliness of disposition.</p>

<p>Mr. Brooke dined at six o'clock, then smoked a cigar
and had a cup of black coffee brought to him in the untidy
little sanctum where he generally did his work. With the
coffee came the black kitten, which sidled up to him on
the table, purring, and rubbing her head against his arm
as if she knew him for a friend. He stroked it occasionally
as he read his evening papers, and stroked it in the
caressing way which cats love, from its forehead to the
tip of its stumpy tail. It was while he was thus engaged
that a tap at the door was heard, and the tap was followed
by the entrance of a young man, who looked as if he
were quite at home.</p>

<p>"Can I come in?" he said, in a perfunctory sort of
way; and then, without waiting for any reply, went on&mdash;
"I've no engagement to-night, so I thought I would look
in here first, and see whether you had started."</p>

<p>"All right. Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"Special meeting&mdash;Church and State Union," said the
young man with a smile. "I went partly in a medical
capacity, partly because I was curious to know how they
managed to unite the two professions."</p>

<p>"Couldn't your sister tell you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't allow Ethel to attend such mixed gatherings,"
said the visitor, seating himself on the edge of the
library table, and beginning to play with the cat.</p>

<p>"You are unusually particular," said Mr. Brooke, with
an amused look. But Maurice Kenyon, as the visitor was
named, continued to attract the kitten's notice, without the
answering protest which Caspar Brooke had expected.</p>

<p>Maurice Kenyon was nearly thirty, and had stepped by
good fortune into the shoes of a medical uncle who had
left him a large and increasing general practice in the
West Central district. The young man's popularity was
not entirely owing to his skill, although he had an exceedingly
good repute among his brethren in medicine. Neither
was it attributable to good looks. He owed it rather to a
sympathetic manner, to the cheerful candor of his dark
grey eyes, to the mixture of firmness and delicate kindness<a name="Page_38"></a>
by which his treatment of his patients was characterized.
He was especially successful in his dealings with children;
and he had therefore a good deal of adoration from grateful
mothers to put up with. But of his skill and intellectual
power there could be no doubt; and these qualities,
coupled with his winning manner, bade fair to raise him to
a very high place in his profession.</p>

<p>There was one little check, and one only, to the flow of
Mr. Kenyon's prosperity. Careful mothers occasionally
objected that he was not married, and that his sister was
an actress. Why did he let his sister go on the stage?
And why, if she was an actress, did he allow her to live in
his house? It did not seem quite respectable in the eyes
of some worthy people that these things should be. But
Mr. Kenyon only laughed when reports of these sayings,
reached him, and went on his way unmoved, as his sister
Ethel went on hers. And in London, the question of a
doctor's relations, his sisters, his cousins, his aunts, and
what they do for a living, is not so important as it is in the
country. Maurice Kenyon's care of his sister, and her
devotion to him, were well known by all their friends; and
as he sometimes said, it mattered very little to him what
all the rest of the world might think.</p>

<p>"Talking of your sister, Kenyon," said Mr. Brooke,
somewhat abruptly, "I suppose you know that my daughter
comes to me to-morrow?"</p>

<p>The connection of ideas was not, perhaps, very obvious,
but Maurice Kenyon nodded as if he understood.</p>

<p>"I suppose she will want a companion. Would Ethel
be so kind as to call on her?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. She will do all she can for Miss Brooke,
I am sure."</p>

<p>"I have been speaking to Mrs. Romaine, too."</p>

<p>"<i>Have</i> you?" Kenyon raised eyebrows a very
little, but Mr. Brooke did not seem to notice the change
of expression.</p>

<p>"&mdash;And she promises to do what she can; but a woman
like Mrs. Romaine is not likely to find many subjects in
common with a girl fresh from a convent."</p>

<p>"I suppose not"&mdash;in the driest of tones.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Romaine," said Brooke, in a more decided tone,
"is a cultivated woman who has made a mark in literature&mdash;&mdash;"<a name="Page_39"></a></p>

<p>"In literature?" queried the doctor.</p>

<p>"She has written a novel or two. She writes for various
papers&mdash;well and smartly, I believe. She is a thorough
woman of the world. Naturally, a girl brought up as
Lesley has been will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;Will find her detestable," said Kenyon, briskly, "as
I and Ethel do. You'll excuse this expression of opinion;
you've heard it before."</p>

<p>For a moment Caspar Brooke's face was overcast; then
he broke into uneasy laughter, and rose from his chair,
shaking himself a little as a big dog sometimes does when
it comes out of the water.</p>

<p>"You are incorrigible," he said. "A veritable heretic
on the matter of my friend, Mrs. Romaine. By the by, I
must remind you, Kenyon, that Mrs. Romaine is a very
old friend of mine."</p>

<p>His manner changed slightly as he spoke. There was
a little touch of quiet hauteur in his look and tone, as if he
wished to repel unsolicited criticism. Maurice understood
the man too well to be offended, and merely changed the
subject.</p>

<p>But when, after half an hour's chat, the young doctor
left the house, his mind reverted to the topic which Mr.
Brooke had broached.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Romaine, indeed! Why, the man's mad&mdash;to
introduce her as a friend to his daughter! Does not all
the world know that Mrs. Romaine caused the separation
between him and his wife? And will the poor girl know?
or has she been kept in the dark completely as to the state
of affairs? Upon my word I'm sorry for her. It strikes
me that she will have a hard row to hoe, if Mrs. Romaine
is at her father's ear."<a name="Page_40"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">OLIVER.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Mr. Brooke</span> had not long quitted Mrs. Romaine's drawing-room
when it was entered by another man, whose
personal resemblance to Mrs. Romaine herself was so
striking that there could be little doubt as to their close
relationship to one another. It was one of those curious
likenesses that exist and thrive upon difference. Rosalind
was not tall, and she was undeniably plump; while her
younger brother, Oliver Trent, was above middle height,
and of a spare habit. The creamy white of Mrs. Romaine's
complexion had turned to deadly pallor in Oliver's
thin, hairless face: and her most striking features were
accentuated, and even exaggerated in his. Her arched
and mobile eyebrows, her dark eyes, her broad nostrils,
curved mouth, and finely-shaped chin, were all to be found,
with a subtle unlikeness, in Oliver's face, and the jetty
hair, short as it was on the man's head, grew low down on
the brow and the nape of the neck exactly as hers did&mdash;although
this resemblance was obscured by the fact that
Rosalind wore a fringe, and carefully curled all the short
hairs at the back of her head.</p>

<p>The greatest difference of all lay in the expression of the
two faces. Mrs. Romaine had certainly no frankness in
her countenance, but she had plenty of smiling pleasantness
and play of emotion. Oliver's face was like a sullen
mask: it was motionless, stolid even, and unamiable.
There were people who raved about his beauty, and nicknamed
him Antinous and Adonis. But these were not
physiognomists....</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine had two brothers, both some years
younger than herself. Oliver, the youngest and her favorite,
was about thirty, and called himself a barrister. As
he had no briefs, however, it was currently reported that
he lived by means of light literature, play, and judicious
sponging upon his sister. The elder brother, Francis, was
a ne'er-do-weel, and seldom appeared upon the scene.<a name="Page_41"></a>
When he did appear, it was always a sign of trouble and
want of cash.</p>

<p>"So you have had Brooke here again?" Oliver inquired.</p>

<p>"How did you know, Noll?"</p>

<p>She turned her dark eyes upon him rather anxiously.
Oliver's views and opinions were of consequence to her.</p>

<p>"I saw him come in. I was coming up, but I turned
round again and went away. Had a smoke in the Square
till I saw him come out. Didn't want to spoil your little
game, whatever it was."</p>

<p>He spoke with a kind of soft drawl, not unpleasing to
the ear at first, but irritating if too long continued. It
seemed to irritate his sister now. She tapped impatiently
on the floor with her toe as she replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"How vulgar you are sometimes, Oliver! But all
society is vulgar now-a-days, and I suppose one ought not
to complain. I have no 'little game,' as you express it,
and there was not the slightest need for you to have stayed
away."</p>

<p>Oliver was sitting on a sofa, with his elbows on his
knees and the tips of his long white fingers meeting each
other. When Mrs. Romaine ended her petulant little
speech he turned his dark eyes upon her and smiled. He
said nothing, however, and his silence offended his sister
even more than his speech.</p>

<p>"It is easy to see that you do not believe me," she said,
"and I think it is very rude of you to be so sceptical. If
you <i>have</i> any remarks to make on the subject pray make
them at once."</p>

<p>"My dear Rosy, I have no remarks to make at all,"
said Oliver, easily. "Take your own way and I shall
take mine. You are good enough to give me plenty of
rope, and I should be uncivil indeed if I commented on the
length of yours."</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine had been moving restlessly to and fro:
she now stood still, on the hearthrug, her hands clasped
before her, her face turned attentively towards her brother.
Evidently she was struck by his words.</p>

<p>"If you would speak out," she said at last, her smooth
voice vibrating as if he had touched some chord of passion
which was usually hushed to silence, "I should know
better what you mean. You deal too much in hints and
insinuations. You have said things of this sort before. I
must know what you mean."<a name="Page_42"></a></p>

<p>"Come, Rosy," said Oliver, rising from his low seat and
confronting her, "don't be so tragic&mdash;so intense. Plump
little women like you shouldn't go in for tragedy. Smile,
Rosy; it is your <i>m&eacute;tier</i> to smile. You have won a good
many games by smiling. You must smile on now&mdash;to the
bitter end."</p>

<p>He smiled himself as he looked at her&mdash;an unpleasant
smile, with thin lips drawn back from white sharp looking
teeth, which gave him the air of a snarling dog. Mrs.
Romaine's face belied his words. It was tragic enough,
intense enough, for a woman who had known mortal
agony; the suggestion of placidity usually given by her
smiling lips and rounded unwrinkled cheeks had disappeared;
she might have stood for an impersonation of
sorrow and despair. Oliver's mocking voice recalled her
to herself.</p>

<p>"A very good pose, Rosalind. The Tragic Muse indeed.
Are you going to rival Ethel Kenyon? I am
afraid it is rather late for you to go on the stage, that's all.
Let me see: you have touched forty, have you not? I
would acknowledge only thirty-nine if I were you. There
is more than a year's difference between thirty-nine and
forty."</p>

<p>The strained muscles of her face relaxed: she made <a name="tn_47"></a><!--TN: "a a" changed to "a"-->a
little impatient gesture with her hands, then turned to
the fireplace, and with one arm upon the mantelpiece,
looked down into the fire.</p>

<p>"You drive me nearly mad sometimes, Oliver," she said,
in a low, passionate voice, "by your habit of saying only
half a thing at a time. I know well enough that you are
remonstrating with me now: that you disapprove of something&mdash;and
will not tell me what. By and by, if I am in
trouble or perplexity, you will turn round upon me and
say that you warned me&mdash;told me that you disapproved&mdash;or
something of that sort. You always do it, and it is not
fair. Innuendoes are not warnings."</p>

<p>"My dear Rosalind," said her brother, coolly, "I hope
I know my place. I'm ten years younger than you are,
and have been at various times much indebted to your
generosity. It does not become me to take exception at
anything that girls may like to do."</p>

<p>He had the exasperating habit of treating kindness to
himself with an air of condescension, as if he conferred a<a name="Page_43"></a>
favor by accepting benefits. His smile of superiority hurt
Mrs. Romaine.</p>

<p>"When you adopt that tone, Oliver, I hate you!" she
cried.</p>

<p>"You are very impulsive, Rosy&mdash;in spite of your years,"
said Oliver, with his usual quietness. "I assure you I do
not wish to interfere; and you must set it down to
brotherly affection if I sometimes feel inclined to wonder
what you mean to do."</p>

<p>"To do?" she queried, looking round at him.</p>

<p>"Yes, to do. I don't understand you, that is all. Of
course, it is not necessary that I should understand."</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine did not often change color, but she
flushed scarlet now, and was glad for a moment that the
room was almost dark. Yet, as her brother stood close to
her, and the fire was sending up fitful flashes of ruddy
light, she felt certain, on reflection, that he had seen that
blush. This certainly imparted some humility to her voice
as she spoke again.</p>

<p>"You know, Oliver, that I always like you to approve
of what I am doing. I like you to understand. Of course,
whatever I do, it is partly for your sake."</p>

<p>"Is it?" said Oliver, with a laugh. "I shouldn't have
thought it. As far as I can judge, you have been very
careful to please yourself all through."</p>

<p>There was a little silence. Then she said, in a low tone,</p>

<p>"<i>How</i> have I pleased myself, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"Do you want a plain statement of facts? Well, my
dear, you know them as well as I do, though perhaps you
do not know the light in which they present themselves to
me. We three, you and Francis and I, were left to earn
our own living at a somewhat early age. Francis became
a banker's clerk, and you took to literature and governessing
and general popularity. By a very clever stroke you
managed to induce Professor Romaine to marry you. He
was fifty and you were twenty-four. You did very well for
yourself&mdash;twisted him round your little finger, and got
him to leave you all his money; but really I do not see
how this could be said to be for my sake."</p>

<p>"Then you are very ungrateful, Oliver. You were a boy
of fourteen when I married, and what would you have
done but for Mr. Romaine and myself?"</p>

<p>"You forget, my dear," said Oliver, smoothly, "that I
was never exactly dependent on you for a livelihood. I<a name="Page_44"></a>
took scholarships at school and college, and there was a
certain sum of money invested in the Funds for my other
expenses. It was perhaps not a large sum, but it was
enough. I have to thank you for some very pleasant
weeks at your house during the holidays; but there was
really no necessity for you to marry Peter Romaine in
order to provide for my holidays."</p>

<p>She winced under his tone of banter, but did not speak.
She seemed resolved to let him say what he liked. Rosalind
Romaine might not be perfect in all relations of life,
but she was certainly a good sister.</p>

<p>"When a few years had elapsed," her brother went on,
in a light narrative tone, "I'll grant that Romaine was of
considerable service to us. He got Francis out of several
scrapes, and he shoved me into a Government office,
where the duties are not particularly onerous. Oh, yes, I
owe some thanks to Romaine."</p>

<p>"And none to me for marrying him?"</p>

<p>Oliver laughed. "My dear Rosy," he said, "I have
mentioned before that I consider you married him to
please yourself."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders, but said nothing more.</p>

<p>"Romaine became useful to me, of course," said Oliver,
reflectively; "and then came the first extraordinary
hitch. We met the Brookes&mdash;how many years ago&mdash;nearly
twelve, I suppose; and you formed a gushing
friendship with Lady Alice Brooke and her husband,
especially with her husband."</p>

<p>"Why do you rake up these old stories?"</p>

<p>"Because I want to understand your position. You
amazed me then, and you seem more than ever disposed
to amaze me now. You were attracted by Caspar Brooke&mdash;heaven
knows why! and you made no secret of the fact.
You liked the man, and he liked you. I don't know how
far the friendship went&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There was nothing in it but the most ordinary, innocent
acquaintanceship!"</p>

<p>"Lady Alice did not think so. Lady Alice made a
devil of a row about it, as far as I understand. Everyone
who knows the story blames you, Rosalind, for the quarrel
and separation between husband and wife."</p>

<p>"It was not my fault."</p>

<p>"Oh, was it not? Well, perhaps not. At any rate,
the husband and wife separated quietly, twelve years ago.<a name="Page_45"></a>
I don't know whether you hoped that Brooke would give
his wife any justification for her suspicions&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oliver, you are brutal! You insult me! I have never
given you reason to think so ill of me."</p>

<p>"I think of you," said Oliver, slowly, "only as I think
of all women. I don't suppose you are better or worse
than the rest. As it happened the whole thing seemed to
die down after that separation. Romaine whisked you off
to Calcutta with him. Then he fell ill, and you had to
nurse him: you and your friend Brooke did not often
meet. Then your husband died, after a long illness, and
you came here again three years ago&mdash;for what object?"</p>

<p>"I had no object but that of living in a part of London
which was familiar to me&mdash;and of being amongst friends.
You have no right at all to call me to account in this
way."</p>

<p>"So I said a few minutes ago. But you remarked that
you wished me to understand and approve of your proceedings.
I am only trying to get at your motives&mdash;if
you have any."</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine was tempted to say that she had no motives.
But she did not think that Oliver would believe
her.</p>

<p>"Here you are," he went on, in his soft, slow voice,
"in friendly&mdash;I might say familiar&mdash;relations with this
man again. His wife is still living, and as bitter against
him as ever, but not likely to give him any pretext for a
divorce. You cannot marry him. Why do you provoke
people to say ill-natured things about you by continuing
so aimless a friendship?"</p>

<p>"I don't think that any one would take the trouble of
saying ill-natured things about me, Oliver," said Mrs. Romaine,
forcing a smile. "We are too conventional, too
advanced, now-a-days, for that kind of thing. Friendship
between a man and woman is by no means the abnormal
and unheard-of thing that it used to be."</p>

<p>"You are not so free as you think you are. You are
still good-looking&mdash;still young. You cannot afford to
defy the world. And I cannot afford to defy it either. I
don't mind a reasonable amount of laxity, but I do not
want my sister to be the heroine of a scandal."</p>

<p>"I think you might trust me to take care of myself."</p>

<p>"I would not say a word if Brooke were a widower.
Although I don't like him, I acknowledge that he is the<a name="Page_46"></a>
sort of big blundering brute that suits some women. But
there's no chance with him, so why should you make a
fool of yourself?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine turned round with a fierce little gesture
of contradiction, but restrained herself, and did not speak
for a minute or two.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?" she said at last, in
rather a breathless kind of way.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Rosy, since you ask me, I should say
that it would be far wiser to drop Brooke's acquaintance."</p>

<p>"That is impossible."</p>

<p>"And why impossible?"</p>

<p>"His daughter is coming to him for a year: he has been
here to-night to ask me to call on her&mdash;to chaperone her
sometimes."</p>

<p>"Is the man a fool?" said Oliver.</p>

<p>"I think," Mrs. Romaine answered, somewhat unsteadily,
"that Mr. Brooke never knew&mdash;exactly&mdash;that his
wife was jealous of me."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's too much to say. He must have known."</p>

<p>"I am pretty sure that he did not. From things that
he has said to me, I feel certain that he attributed only a
passing irritation to her on my account. You do not believe
me, Oliver; but I think that he is perfectly ignorant
of the real cause of her leaving him."</p>

<p>"And <i>you</i> know it?"</p>

<p>"I know it, and Lady Alice knows it: no one else."</p>

<p>"What was it, then? You mean more than simple
jealousy, I see."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;I am not obliged to tell you what it was."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Keep your own counsel, by all means. But
you are placing yourself in a very risky position. Lady Alice
Brooke knows something that would, I suppose, compromise
you in the world's eyes, if it were generally known. Her
daughter is coming to Brooke's house. You mean&mdash;you
seriously mean&mdash;to go to his house and visit this girl?
thereby offending her mother (who is sure to hear of the
visit) and bringing down the ill-will of all the Courtleroys
upon your head? Have you no regard for your character
and your position in the world? You are risking both,
and you have nothing to gain."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have."</p>

<p>"What is it?"<a name="Page_47"></a></p>

<p>"I cannot tell you."</p>

<p>"You mean you will not tell me?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so."</p>

<p>Oliver Trent deliberately took a match-box from the
mantelpiece, struck a match, and lighted a wax candle. "I
should like to see your face," he said.</p>

<p>Rosalind looked at him fully and steadily for a few
seconds; then her eyelids fell, and for the second time
that evening the color mounted in her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>"I think that I know the truth," said her brother, composedly,
after a careful study of her face. "You are mad,
Rosalind, and you will live to rue that madness."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," she said, turning away
from the light of the candle. "You speak in riddles."</p>

<p>"I will speak in riddles, then, no longer. I will be very
plain with you. Rosalind, you are in love with Caspar
Brooke."</p>

<p>She sank down on a low chair as if her limbs would
support her no longer and rested her face upon her hands.</p>

<p>"No," she said, in a low voice, "you are wrong: I do
not love Caspar Brooke."</p>

<p>"What other motive can you have?"</p>

<p>She waited for a moment, and then said, still softly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suppose I may as well tell you. I loved him once.
In those first days of our acquaintance&mdash;when he was
disappointed in his wife and seeking for sympathy elsewhere&mdash;I
thought that he cared for me. I was mistaken.
Oliver, can you keep my secret? No other soul in the
world knows of this from me but you. I told him my
love. I wrote to him&mdash;a wild, mad letter&mdash;offering to fly
to the ends of the earth with him if he would go."</p>

<p>Oliver stared at her as if he could not believe his ears.</p>

<p>"And what answer did he make?"</p>

<p>"He made none&mdash;because he never saw it. That letter
fell into Lady Alice's hands. She did not know that it
was the first that had been written: she took it to be one
of a series. She wrote a short note to me about it; and
the next thing I heard was that she had gone. But I
know that he never saw that letter of mine."</p>

<p>"All this," said Oliver, in a hard contemptuous voice,
"does not explain your present line of conduct."</p>

<p>She lifted her face from her hands. "Yes, it does," she
said quickly. "If you were a woman you would under<a name="Page_48"></a>stand!
Do you think I want her to come back to him?
No, if he cannot make me happy, he shall not be happy
at <i>her</i> side. I shall never forgive her for the words she
wrote to me! If her daughter comes, Oliver, it is all the
more reason why I should be here, ready to nip any notion
of reconciliation in the bud. It is hate, not love, that
dominates me: it is in my hatred for Caspar Brooke's wife
that you must seek the explanation of my actions. <i>Now</i>,
do you understand?"</p>

<p>"I understand enough," said Oliver, drily.</p>

<p>"And you will not interfere?"</p>

<p>"For the present I will not interfere. But I will not
bind myself. I must see more of what you are doing before
I make any promises. Whatever you do, you must
not compromise yourself or me."</p>

<p>"Hate!" he repeated to himself scornfully as he left the
house at a somewhat later hour in the evening. "It is all
very well to put it down to her hate for Lady Alice. She
is still in love with Brooke; and that is the beginning and
the end of it."</p>

<p>And Oliver was not far wrong.<a name="Page_49"></a></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">LESLEY COMES HOME.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Caspar Brooke</span> was a busy man, and he was quite determined
that his daughter's arrival should make no difference
in his habits. In this determination he was less selfish
than stern: he had reason to believe that his wife's treatment
of him proceeded from folly and fickleness, and that
his daughter had inherited her foibles. It was not worth
while, he said to himself, to make any radical change in his
way of life: Lesley must accommodate herself, if she could,
to his habits; and if she could not, she must go back to
her mother. He was not prepared, he told himself, to alter
his hours, or his friendships, or his peculiarities one whit
for Lesley's sake.</p>

<p>Lesley arrived an hour later than the time at which she
had been expected. It was nearly eight o'clock when her
cab stopped at the door of the house in Upper Woburn
Place, and the evening was foggy and cold. To Lesley,
fresh from the clear skies and air of a French city, street,
house, and atmosphere alike seemed depressing. The
chimes of St. Pancras' church, woefully out of tune, fell on
her ear, and made her shiver as she mounted the steps that
led to the front door. How dear they were to grow to her
in time she did not then suspect, nor would have easily
believed! At present their discordance was part of the
general discordance of all things, and increased the weight
of dejection which lay upon her. Her mother's maid had
orders to deliver her over to Mr. Brooke and then to come
away: she was not to spend an hour in the house, nor to
partake of food within its walls. She had strict orders
from Lady Alice on this point.</p>

<p>The house was a very good house, as London dwellings
go; but to Lesley's eyes it looked strangely mean and
narrow. It was very tall, and the front was painted a
chocolate brown. The double front doors, which opened
to admit Lesley's boxes, showed an ordinary London hall,<a name="Page_50"></a>
narrow, crowded with an oaken chest, an umbrella and hat
stand, and lighted by a flaring gas lamp. At these doors
two persons showed themselves; a neat but hard-featured
maid-servant, and a lady of uncertain age, whom Lesley
correctly guessed to be his sister and housekeeper, Miss
Brooke. There was no sign of her father.</p>

<p>"Is this Mr. Brooke's house?" inquired Dayman, formally.
She used to know Mr. Brooke by sight, for she had
lived with Lady Alice for many years.</p>

<p>"Yes, this is the house, and this is his daughter, I suppose?"
said Miss Brooke, coming forward, and taking
Lesley's limp hand in hers. Miss Brooke had a keen,
clever, honest face, but she was undeniably plain, and
Lesley was not in a condition to appreciate the kindness
of her glance.</p>

<p>"I must see Mr. Brooke himself before I leave my young
lady," Dayman announced.</p>

<p>"Run and fetch your master, Sarah," said Miss Brooke,
quickly. "He cannot have heard the cab."</p>

<p>The white-aproned servant disappeared into the back
premises, and thence, in a moment or two, issued Mr.
Caspar Brooke himself, at the sight of whom Miss
Brooke involuntarily frowned and bit her lip. She saw
at one glance that Caspar was in his "study-coat,"
that his hair was dishevelled, and that he had just laid
down his pipe. These were small details in themselves,
but they meant a good deal. They meant that Caspar
Brooke would not do a single thing, would not go a single
step out of his way, to conciliate the affections of Lady
Alice's daughter. He had never in his life looked more of
a Bohemian than he did just then. And Miss Brooke suspected
him of wilful perversity.</p>

<p>The lights swam before Lesley's eyes. The vision of a
big, brown-bearded man, bigger and broader, it seemed to
her, than any man she had ever spoken to before, took
away her senses. As he came up to her she involuntarily
shrank back; and when he stooped to kiss her, the novel
sensation of his bristly beard against her face, the strong
scent of tobacco, and the sense that she was unwelcome,
all contributed towards complete self-betrayal. Dizzy from
her voyage; faint, sick, and unhinged, she almost pushed
him away from her and sank down on a hall-chair with a
burst of sobbing which she could not control. She was<a name="Page_51"></a>
terribly ashamed of herself next moment; but the next
moment was too late. She had made as bad a beginning
as she had it in her power to make, and no after-apology
could alter what was done.</p>

<p>For a moment a dead silence fell on the little group.
Miss Brooke heard her brother mutter something beneath
his breath in a very angry tone. She wondered whether
his daughter heard it too. The faithful and officious Dayman
immediately pressed forward with soothing words and
offers of help.</p>

<p>"There, there, my dear young lady, don't take on so.
It won't be for long, remember; and I'll come for you again
to take you back to your mamma&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You had better leave her alone, Dayman," said Mr.
Brooke, coldly. "She will probably be more reasonable
by and bye."</p>

<p>Lesley was on her feet again in a moment. "I am not
unreasonable," she said distinctly, but with a little catch
in her voice; "it is only that I am tired and upset with the
journey&mdash;and the sudden light was too much for me. Give
mamma my love, Dayman, and say that I am very well."</p>

<p>"Are the boxes all in?" asked Mr. Brooke. "We need
not detain you, Mrs. Dayman."</p>

<p>Dayman turned and dropped him a mocking curtsey.
"I have my orders from my mistress, sir. Having seen
the young lady safe into your hands, I will go back to my
lady at the railway station, where she now is, and tell her
how she was received."</p>

<p>Miss Brooke, glancing anxiously at her brother, saw him
bite his lip and frown. He did not speak, but he pointed
to the door in a manner which Dayman did not see fit to
disobey.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Miss Lesley&mdash;and I'll look forward to the
day when I see you back again," said the maid, in a tone
of profound commiseration.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Dayman, give my love to mamma," said
Lesley. She would dearly have liked to add, "Don't tell
her that I cried;" but with that circle of unsympathetic
faces round her, she did not dare. She pressed her lips
together, dashed the tears from her eyes, and managed to
smile, however, as Dayman took her departure.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Miss Brooke had quietly sent the maid for
a glass of wine, which she administered to the girl without<a name="Page_52"></a>
further ado. Lesley drank it obediently, and felt reinvigorated:
but although her courage rose, her spirit remained
sadly low as she looked at her father's face, and saw that
it wore an uncompromising frown.</p>

<p>"You had better have these boxes carried upstairs as
soon as possible," he remarked to his sister. "I will say
good-night now: I have to go out."</p>

<p>He turned away rather brusquely, and went back into
his study, which was situated behind the dining-room, on
the ground-floor. Lesley looked after him helplessly, with
a mingled feeling of offence and relief. She did not see
him again, but was conveyed to her room by Miss Brooke,
who spoke to her kindly indeed, but with a matter-of-fact
directness which seemed hard and cold to the convent-bred
girl, whose teachers and guardians had vied with one
another in sugared sweetness and a tutored amiability of
demeanor.</p>

<p>Lesley was taken up two flights of stairs to a room which
seemed close and stuffy to her, although in English eyes it
might be deemed comfortable and even luxurious. But
padded arm-chairs and couch, eider-down silken-covered
quilts, cushions, curtains, and carpets, were things of which
she had as yet no great appreciation. The room seemed
to her altogether too full of furniture, and she longed to
run to the window for a breath of fresh air. Miss Brooke,
observing how white she looked, asked her if she felt
faint.</p>

<p>"No, thank, you; I am only tired," said Lesley.</p>

<p>"You would like some tea, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the girl, rather hesitatingly. Nobody
drank tea at the convent, and in her visits to Lady
Alice she had not cultivated a taste for it. "I think I
would rather go to bed."</p>

<p>"You must have something to eat before you go," said
Miss Brooke, drily. "Here, let me feel your pulse. Yes,
you need food, and I'll send you up a soothing draught as
well. You need not look so astonished, my dear: don't
you know that I'm a doctor?"</p>

<p>"A doctor! <i>You!</i>" Lesley looked round the room as
if seeking for some place in which to hide from such a
monstrosity.</p>

<p>"Yes, a doctor&mdash;a lady doctor," said Miss Brooke, with
grim but not unmirthful emphasis. "You never saw me<a name="Page_53"></a>
before, did you? Well, I'm not in general practice just
now; my health would not stand it, so I am keeping my
brother's house instead; but I am fully qualified, my dear,
I assure you, and can prescribe for you if you are ill as
well as any physician in the land."</p>

<p>She laughed as she spoke, and there was a humorous
twinkle in her shrewd, kindly eyes, which Lesley did not
understand. As a matter of fact, her innocent horror and
amaze tickled Miss Brooke immensely. It was evident
that this girl, with her foreign, aristocratic, and Catholic
training knew nothing at all of the strides that have of late
been made in the direction of female emancipation; and
her ignorance was amusing to Miss Brooke, who was one
of the foremost champions of the woman's cause. Miss
Sophia Brooke, whose name was on every committee under
the sun, who spoke at meetings and wrote half a dozen
letters after her name, to have a niece who had never met
a lady doctor in her life before, and probably did not know
anything at all about women's franchise! It was quite
too funny, and Miss Brooke&mdash;or Doctor Brooke, as she
liked better to be called&mdash;was genuinely amused. But it
was not an amusing matter to Lesley, who felt as if the
foundations of the solid world were shaking underneath
her.</p>

<p>If she had heard of women doctors at all it was in terms
of bitterest reprobation: she had been told that they were
not persons of respectability, that they were "without the
pale," and she had believed all she was told. And here
she was, shut up for a year with a woman of the very class
that she had been taught to reprobate&mdash;a woman, too, who,
although no longer young, had a face which was pleasant
to look upon, because it expressed refinement and kindliness
as well as intellectual power, and whose dress, though
plain, was severely neat, well-fitting, and of rich material.
In fact, Miss Brooke was so unlike anything in the shape
of womankind that Lesley had ever encountered, that the
girl could only gaze at her in speechless amazement, and
wonder whether <i>she</i> was expected to develop into something
of the same sort!</p>

<p>She could not deny, however, that her aunt was very
good-natured. Miss Brooke helped her to undress, put
her to bed, unpacked her boxes in about half the time that
a maid would have taken to do the work; then she brought<a name="Page_54"></a>
her something to eat and drink, and waited on her with
the care of a woman with a truly kindly heart. Lesley began
to take courage and to ask questions.</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall see my father again to-morrow morning,"
she said.</p>

<p>"About mid-day you may see him," Miss Brooke answered,
cheerfully. "He will be out till two or three in
the morning, you know; and of course he can't be disturbed
very early. You must remember that we keep the
house very quiet until eleven or twelve, when he generally
comes down. He breakfasts then, and goes out."</p>

<p>Lesley was mystified. Why did her father keep such
extraordinary hours? She had not the slightest notion
that these were the usual arrangements of a journalist's
life. She thought that he must be very thoughtless, very
self-indulgent, even very wicked. Surely her mother had
been more than justified in leaving him. She laid her
head upon the pillow, feeling rather inclined to cry.</p>

<p>Miss Brooke had not much of a clue to her emotions;
but she was trying hard to fathom what was passing in the
girl's mind, and she came very near the mark. She stooped
down and kissed her affectionately.</p>

<p>"I daresay you feel lonely and strange, my dear," she
said; "but you must remember that you have come to
your own home, and that we belong to you, and you to us.
So you must put up with us for a time, and you may&mdash;eventually&mdash;come
to like us, you know. Stranger things
than that have happened before now."</p>

<p>Lesley put one arm round her aunt's neck, undeterred
by Miss Brooke's laugh and the little struggle she made to
get away.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said, "for being so kind. I am sorry
I cried when I came in."</p>

<p>"You were hysterical and overwrought. I shall tell
your father so."</p>

<p>"You think he was vexed?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Miss Brooke, "that a man hardly
likes to see his daughter burst out crying and shrink away
when she first looks at him."</p>

<p>"Oh, I was very stupid!" cried Lesley, remorsefully.
"It must have looked so bad, and I did not mean anything&mdash;at
least, I meant only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand all about it," said her aunt, "and I shall
tell your father what I think if he alludes to the matter.<a name="Page_55"></a>
In the meantime you had better go to sleep, and wake up
fresh and bright in the morning. Good-night, my dear."</p>

<p>And Lesley was left to her own reflections.</p>

<p>Although she went early to bed she did not sleep soon
or soundly. There was not much traffic along the street
in which her father lived, but the bells of St. Pancras rang
out the hours and the quarters with painful tunelessness,
and an occasional rumble of wheels would startle her into
wakeful terror. At half-past two in the morning she heard
the opening and shutting of the front door, and her father's
footsteps on the stairs as he came up to bed. There seemed
to her something uncanny in these nocturnal habits. The
life of a journalist, of a literary man, of anybody who did
any definite work in the world at all, was quite unknown
to her.</p>

<p>She came down to breakfast at nine o'clock, feeling
weary and depressed. Miss Brooke was kind but preoccupied;
she had a committee at twelve, she said, and another
at four, so she would be obliged to leave Lesley for
the greater part of the day. "But you will have your own
little arrangements to make you know," she said, "and
Sarah will show you or tell you anything you want. You
might as well fall into our ways as soon as you can."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Lesley. "I only want to be no trouble."</p>

<p>"You'll be no trouble to anybody," said Miss Brooke,
cheerfully, "so long as you find something to do, and do
it. There's a good library of books in the house, and a
piano in the drawing-room; and you ought to go out for
an hour or two every day. I daresay you will be able to
occupy yourself."</p>

<p>"Is there any one to go out with me?" queried Lesley,
timidly. She had never been out alone in the whole course
of her life.</p>

<p>"Go out with you?" repeated Miss Brooke, rather
rudely, though with kind intent. "An able-bodied young
woman of eighteen or nineteen surely can take care of herself!
You are not in Paris now, my dear, you are in London;
and girls in London have to be independent and
courageous."</p>

<p>Lesley felt that she was being somewhat unjustly judged,
but she did not like to reply. And her aunt, conscious of
having spoken sharply, became immediately more gentle
in manner, and told her certain details about the arrange<a name="Page_56"></a>ments
of the house, which it behoved Lesley to know, with
considerable thoughtfulness and kind feeling.</p>

<p>Mr. Brooke usually rang for his coffee about half-past
ten, and came down at half-past eleven. He then had
breakfast served to him in the dining-room, and did not
join his sister at luncheon at all. In the afternoon he
walked out, or wrote, or saw friends; dined at six, and
went down to the office of his paper at eight. From the
office he did not usually return until the small hours of the
morning; and then, as Miss Brooke explained, he often
sat up writing or reading for an hour or two longer.</p>

<p>"Why does he work so late?" asked Lesley, innocently.
"I should have thought the day-time was pleasanter."</p>

<p>Miss Brooke gave a short, explosive laugh, fixed a pair
of eyeglasses on the bridge of her nose, and looked at Lesley
as if she were a natural curiosity.</p>

<p>"Have you yet to learn," she said, "that we don't do
what is pleasant in this life, but what we <i>must</i>?"</p>

<p>Then she got up and went away from the breakfast-table,
leaving Lesley ashamed and confounded. The girl leaned
her elbows upon the white cloth, and furtively wiped a tear
away from her eyes. She found herself in a new atmosphere,
and it did not seem to her a very congenial one.
She was bewildered; it did not appear possible that she
could live for a year in a home of this very peculiar kind.
To her uncultivated imagination, Mr. Brooke and his sister
looked to her like barbarians. She did not understand
their ways at all.</p>

<p>She spent the morning in unpacking her things, and
arranging them, with rather a sad heart, in her room. She
did not like to go downstairs until the luncheon-bell rang;
and then she found that she was to lunch alone. Miss
Brooke was out; Mr. Brooke was in his study.</p>

<p>The white-capped and severe-visaged middle-aged servant,
who was known as Sarah, came to Lesley after the
meal with a message.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brooke says, Miss, that he would like to see you
in his study, if you can spare him a few minutes."</p>

<p>Lesley flushed hotly as she was shown into the smoky,
little den. It was a scene of confusion, such as she had
never beheld before. The table was heaped high with
papers: books and maps strewed every chair: even the
floor was littered with bulky tomes and piles of manuscript.<a name="Page_57"></a>
At a knee-hole table Caspar Brooke was sitting, writing
hard, as if for dear life, his loose hair falling heavily over
his big forehead, his left hand grasping his thick brown
beard. He looked up as Lesley entered, and gave her a
nod.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," he said. "Wait a minute: I must
finish this and send it off by the quarter to three post. I
have just done."</p>

<p>He went on writing, and Lesley stood motionless beside
the table, with a feeling of dire offence in her proud young
heart. Why had he sent for her if he did not want her?
She was half inclined to walk away without another word.
Only a sense of filial duty restrained her. She thought to
herself that she had never been treated so unceremoniously&mdash;even
in her earliest days at school. And she was surprised
to find that so small a thing could ruffle her so much.
She had hardly known at the convent, or while visiting her
mother, that she had such a thing as a "temper." It suddenly
<a name="tn_62"></a><!-- TN: "occurrred" changed to "occurred"-->occurred to her now that her temper was very bad
indeed.</p>

<p>And in truth she had a hot, strong temper&mdash;very like
her father's, if she had but known it&mdash;and a will that was
prone to dominate, not to submit itself to others. These
were facts that she had yet to learn.</p>

<p>"Well, Lesley," said Caspar Brooke, laying down his
pen, "I have finished my work at last. Now we can
talk."<a name="Page_58"></a></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">FRIENDS AND FOES.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Something</span> in the slightly mutinous expression of Lesley's
face seemed to strike her father. He looked at her
fixedly for a minute or two, then smiled a little, and
began to busy himself amongst his papers.</p>

<p>"You are very like your mother," he said.</p>

<p>Lesley felt a thrill of strong indignation. How dared
he speak of her mother to her without shame and grief
and repentance? She flushed to her temples and cast
down her eyes, for she was resolved to say nothing that
she might afterwards regret.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?" said Mr. Brooke, indifferently.
"You must make yourself at home, you know. If you
don't, I'm afraid you will be uncomfortable. You will
have to look after yourself."</p>

<p>Lesley made no answer. She was thinking that it would
be very disagreeable to look after herself. She did not
know how clearly her face expressed her sentiments.</p>

<p>"You don't much like the prospect, apparently?" said
her father. "Well"&mdash;for he was becoming a little provoked
by her silence&mdash;"what <i>would</i> you like? Do you
want a maid?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, thank you," said Lesley, startled into speech.</p>

<p>"You can have one if you like, you know. Speak to
your aunt about it. I suppose you have not been accustomed
to wait upon yourself. Can you do your own
hair?"</p>

<p>He spoke with a smile, half-indulgent, half-contemptuous.
Lesley remembered, with intuitive comprehension of his
mood, that her mother was singularly helpless, and never
dressed without Dayman's help, or brushed the soft tresses
that were still so luxuriant and so fair. She rebelled at
once against the unspoken criticism.</p>

<p>"I can do everything for myself," she said; "I can do
my own hair and mend my dresses and everything, because<a name="Page_59"></a>
I am a schoolgirl; but of course when I am older I expect
to have my own maid, as every lady does."</p>

<p>Mr. Brooke's short, hard laugh was distinctly unpleasing
to her ear.</p>

<p>"I think you will find, when you are older," he said, with
an emphasis on the words, "that a great many ladies have
to do without maids&mdash;and very much better for them that
they should&mdash;but as I do not wish to stint you in anything,
nor to oppose any fairly reasonable desire of yours, I will
tell your aunt to get you a maid as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, please!" cried Lesley, more alarmed than
pleased by the prospect. "I really do not wish for one;
I do not wish you to have the trouble&mdash;the ex&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped short: she did not quite like to speak of
the "expense."</p>

<p>"It will not be much trouble to me if Sophia finds you
a maid," said her father drily; "and as to the expense,
which is what I suppose you were going to allude to, I am
quite well able to afford it. Otherwise I should not have
proposed such a thing."</p>

<p>Lesley felt herself snubbed, and did not like it, but again
kept silence.</p>

<p>"I cannot promise you much amusement while you stay
here," Mr. Brooke went on, "but anything that you like to
see or hear when you are in town can be easily provided for.
I mean in the way of picture galleries, concerts, theatres&mdash;things
of that kind. Your Aunt Sophia will probably
be too much occupied to take you to such places; but if
you have a maid you will be pretty independent. I wonder
she did not think of it herself. Of course a maid can go
about with you, and so relieve her mind."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to be troublesome," said Lesley, stiffly.</p>

<p>He cast an amused glance at her. "You won't trouble
<i>me</i>, my dear. And Mrs. Romaine says that she will call
and make your acquaintance. I dare say you will find
her a help to you."</p>

<p>"Is she&mdash;a friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"A very old friend," said Caspar Brooke, with decision.
"Then there are the Kenyons, who live opposite. Ethel
Kenyon is a clever girl&mdash;a great favorite of mine. Her
brother is a doctor."</p>

<p>"And she lives with him and keeps his house?" said
Lesley, growing interested.<a name="Page_60"></a></p>

<p>"Well, she lives with him. I don't know that she does
much in the way of keeping his house. I hope I shall not
shock your prejudices"&mdash;how did he know that she had
any prejudices?&mdash;"if I tell you that she is an actress."</p>

<p>"An actress!"&mdash;Lesley flushed with surprise, even with
a little horror, though at the same moment she was conscious
of a movement of pleasant curiosity and a desire
to know what an actress was like in private life.</p>

<p>"I thought you would be horrified," said her father,
looking at her with something very like satisfaction. "How
could you be anything else? How long have you lived in a
French convent? Eight or ten years, is it not? Ah, well, I
can't be surprised if you have imbibed the conventional
idea of what you would call, I suppose, your class." He
gave a little shrug to his broad shoulders. "It can't be
helped now. You must make yourself as happy as you can,
my poor child, as long as you are here, and console yourself
with visions of your happy future at the Courtleroys'."</p>

<p>It was exactly what Lesley intended to do, and yet she
felt hurt by the slightly contemptuous pity of his tone.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt that I shall be very happy," she said,
steadying her voice as well as she could; "and I hope
that you will not concern yourself about me."</p>

<p>"I should not have time to do so if I wished," he
answered coolly. "I never concern myself about anything
but my proper business, which is <i>not</i> to look after girls of
eighteen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then why did you send for me here?" she asked, with
lightning rapidity.</p>

<p>The question seemed to surprise him. He raised his
eyebrows as he looked at her.</p>

<p>"That was a family arrangement made many years
ago," he answered at last deliberately. "And I think it
was a wise one. There is no reason why you should grow
up in utter ignorance of your father. And I prefer you to
come when you have arrived at something like a reasonable
age, rather than when you were quite a child. As you <i>are</i>
at a reasonable age, Lesley," with a lightening of his tones,
"I suppose you have some tastes, some inclinations, of
your own? What are they?"</p>

<p>It must have been obstinacy that prompted Lesley's
answer. "I have no taste," she said, looking down. "No
inclinations."<a name="Page_61"></a></p>

<p>"Are you not fond of music?"</p>

<p>"I play a little&mdash;a very little."</p>

<p>"Oh." The tone was one of disappointment. "Art?
Drawing&mdash;carving&mdash;modelling&mdash;any of the fads young
ladies are so fond of now-a-days?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you read much?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What do you do, then?"</p>

<p>"I can embroider a little," said Lesley, calmly. "The
nuns taught me. And I can dance."</p>

<p>She raised her eyes and studied the stormy expressions
that flitted one after another across her father's face. She
knew that she had taken a delight in provoking him, and
she wondered whether he was not going to retaliate by an
angry word. But after a few moments' pause he only
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Would you like any lessons in singing or drawing now
that you are in town?"</p>

<p>The offer was a temptation to Lesley. Yes, she would
dearly have liked some good singing lessons; her mother
even had suggested that she should take them while she
was in London. She was the fortunate possessor of a
voice that was worth cultivating, and she longed to make
the best of her time. But she had come with the notion
that her father was poor, and that she must not be an
unnecessary expense to him; and this idea had not
been counteracted by any appearance of luxury or lavish
expenditure in her London home. The furniture, except
in her own room, was heavy, old-fashioned, and decidedly
shabby. Her father seemed to work very hard. He had
already promised her a maid; and Lesley could not bear
to ask him for anything else. So she answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, I think not, thank you."</p>

<p>There might be generosity, but there was also some
resentment and hot temper at the bottom of Lesley's reply.
This was a fact, however, that her father did not discern.
He merely paused for a moment, nodded his head once or
twice, and seemed slightly disconcerted. Then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very well; do just as you like. Your aunt has a
Mudie subscription, I believe"&mdash;what this meant Lesley
had not the faintest idea&mdash;"and you will find books in the
library, and a piano in the drawing-room. You must ask<a name="Page_62"></a>
for anything you want." As if that was likely, Lesley
thought! "I hope you will make friends and be comfortable.
And&mdash;a&mdash;" he paused, and hesitated in his speech
as he went on&mdash;"a&mdash;I hope&mdash;your mother&mdash;Lady Alice&mdash;was
well when you left her?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well," Lesley answered, dropping her eyes.</p>

<p>"Was she going to Scotland for the winter?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"Oh." He seemed satisfied with the answer. "By
the way, Lesley, are you Catholic or Protestant?"</p>

<p>"Protestant. Mamma would not allow the Sisters to
talk to me about religion. I always drove to the English
Church on Sundays."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well. Do as you please. There are plenty
of churches near us. But you need not bring more clergy
than you can help to the house," said Brooke, with a
peculiar smile. "I am not very fond of the Blacks. I am
more of a Red myself, you know."</p>

<p>"A Red?" Lesley asked, helplessly.</p>

<p>"A Red Republican&mdash;Radical&mdash;Socialist&mdash;anything you
like," said Brooke, laughing outright. "You didn't read
the papers in your convent, I suppose. You had better
begin to study them straight away. It will be a pleasant
change from the Lives of the Saints. And now, if we
have finished all that we have to say&mdash;I am rather busy,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon: I will go," said Lesley, rising
at once. "I had no wish to intrude upon you," she added,
with an attempt to be dignified and womanly, which she
felt to be a miserable failure. Her father simply nodded
in reply, took up his pen, and allowed her to leave the
room.</p>

<p>But when she had gone, he put the pen down and sat
back in his chair, musing. Lesley had surprised him a
little. She had more force and fire in her composition
than he had expected to find. She was, as he had said,
very like her mother in face and figure; and the minute
differences of line and contour that showed Lesley to be
strong where Lady Alice had been weak, original where
Lady Alice had been most conventional, intellectual where
Lady Alice had been only intelligent, were not perceptible
at first sight even to a practised observer of men and
women like Caspar Brooke. But the flash of her brown<a name="Page_63"></a>
eyes, so like his own, and an occasional intonation in her
voice, had told him something. She was in arms against
him, so much he felt; and she had more individuality than
her mother, in spite of her ignorance. It was a pity that
her education had been so much neglected! Manlike,
Caspar Brooke took literally every word that she had
uttered; and reproached himself for having allowed his
foolish, frivolous wife to bring up his daughter in a place
where she had been taught nothing but embroidery and
dancing.</p>

<p>"It is a pity," he reflected; "but we cannot alter the
matter now. The poor girl will feel herself sadly out of
place in this house, I fear; but perhaps it won't do her
any harm. She may be a better woman all her life&mdash;the
idle, selfish, self-indulgent life that she is bound by all her
traditions and her upbringing to lead&mdash;for having seen for
a few months what honest work is like. She is too handsome
not to marry well: let us only hope that Alice won't
secure a duke for her. She will if she can; and I&mdash;well,
I haven't much opinion of dukes." And so with a laugh
and a shrug, Caspar Brooke returned to his work.</p>

<p>Lesley went upstairs to the drawing-room with burning
cheeks and a lump in her throat. She was offended by
her father's manner towards her, although she could not
but acknowledge that in essentials he had seemed wishful
to be kind. And she knew that she had seemed ungracious
and had felt resentful. But the resentment, she assured
herself, was all on her mother's account. If he had treated
Lady Alice as he had treated Lady Alice's daughter&mdash;with
hardly concealed contempt, with the scornful indifference
of one looking down from a superior height&mdash;Lesley did
not wonder that her mother had left him. It was a manner
which had never been displayed to her before, and she said
to herself that it was horribly discourteous. And the
worst of it was that it did not seem to be directed to herself
alone: it included her friends the nuns, her mother,
her mother's family, and all the circle of aristocratic
relations to which she belonged. She was despised as
part of the class which he despised; and it was difficult
for her to understand the situation.</p>

<p>It would have been easier if she could have set her
father down as a mere boor, without refinement or intelligence;
but there was one item in her impression of him<a name="Page_64"></a>
which she could not reconcile with a want of culture. She
was keenly sensitive to sound; and voices were important
to her in her judgment of acquaintances. Now, Caspar
Brooke had a delightful voice. It was low, musical, and
finely modulated: his accent, moreover, was particularly
delicate and refined. Lesley had, without knowing it, the
same charmingly modulated intonation; and her father's
voice was instinctively familiar to her. People had often
said that it was hard to dislike a man with a voice like
Caspar Brooke's; and Lesley was not insensible to its
fascination. No, he could not be a mere insensate clod,
with that pleasant and cultivated voice, she decided to
herself; but he might be something worse&mdash;a heartless
man of the <a name="tn_69"></a><!-- TN: "word" changed to "world"-->world, who cared for nothing but himself and
his own low ambitions: not a man who was worthy to be
the husband of a gentle, loving, highly-organized woman
like the daughter of Lord Courtleroy.</p>

<p>With a deep sigh, Lesley ceased at last to meditate,
and began to look about her. The room was large and
lofty, and had three windows, opening upon a balcony.
There were more books than Lesley had usually seen in
drawing-rooms, and there was a very handsome Broadwood
grand piano. The furniture was mostly of the solid type,
handsome enough, but very heavy. Lesley, noticed, however,
that the prints and paintings on the walls were really
good, and that there was some valuable china on the
mantlepiece. It was not an ugly room after all, and it
displayed signs of culture on the part of its occupants;
but Lesley turned from it with an impatient little shake of
her head, expressive of deep disgust. And, indeed, it
was sufficiently unlike the rooms to which she was accustomed
to cause her considerable disappointment.</p>

<p>She drew aside the curtains which hung from the archway
between the back room and the front; and here her
brow cleared. The one wide window looked out on a
space of green grass and trees, inexpressibly refreshing
to Lesley's eye. The walls were lined with rows of books,
from floor to ceiling; and some easy chairs and small
tables gave a look of comfort and purpose to the room.
It was Mr. Brooke's library, though not the room in which
he did his work. That was chiefly done in his little den
downstairs, or at his office in the city.</p>

<p>Lesley looked at the books with great and increasing
pleasure. Here, indeed, was a joy of which her father<a name="Page_65"></a>
could not rob her. No one would take any notice of
what she read. She could "browse undisturbed" over the
whole field of English literature if she were so minded.
And the prospect was a delight.</p>

<p>She sauntered back into the front room, and stood at
one of the windows for a minute or two. Her attention
was speedily attracted by a little pantomime at a window
opposite her own&mdash;a drawing-room window, too, with a
balcony before it, like the window at which she stood. A
young lady in a white dress was talking to a black poodle,
who was standing on his hind-legs, and a young man was
balancing a bit of biscuit on the dog's nose. That was
all. But the young lady was so extremely pretty, and the
young man looked so cheerful and bright, and the poodle
was such an extremely fascinating dog, that Lesley sighed
in very envy of the felicity of all three. And it never
crossed her mind that the pretty girl in the white costume,
who had such a simple and natural look, could possibly be
Ethel Kenyon, the actress, of whom her father had been
speaking half an hour before. Yet such was the case.</p>

<p>She was still observing the figures at the window when
the door opened, and Sarah announced a visitor.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Romaine, please, ma'am."</p>

<p>Whereupon Lesley remembered the "very old friend"
whom Mr. Brooke had mentioned. But was this the very
old friend? This young and <a name="tn_70"></a><!-- TN: "fasionably" changed to "fashionably"-->fashionably-dressed woman, with
short, dark, curling hair, and a white veil to enhance the
whiteness of her complexion. Mrs. Romaine was very
handsome, without a doubt, but Lesley did not like her.</p>

<p>"Miss Brooke?" said the visitor, in a silvery, flute-like
voice, which the girl could not but admire. "You will
forgive me for calling so soon? My old friendship with
Mr. Brooke&mdash;whom I have known for years&mdash;made me
anxious to see you, dear, as soon as possible. You will
receive me also as a friend, I hope&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There could be but one answer. Lesley was delighted.</p>

<p>"I have heard so much of you," murmured Mrs. Romaine,
sitting down with the girl's hand in hers and gazing into
her face with liquid, dreamy eyes; "and I wanted to know
if I could not be of use to you. Dear Miss Brooke is so
much occupied. I may call you Lesley, may I not? Dear
Lesley, it will be the greatest possible pleasure to me to
assist you in any way."<a name="Page_66"></a></p>

<p>"Thank you very much," said Lesley, rather lamely.</p>

<p>"Dear," said Mrs. Romaine, "may I speak to you
frankly? I knew your dear mother many years ago&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lesley turned upon her with suddenly kindled eyes.</p>

<p>"You knew mamma?"</p>

<p>"I did, indeed, and I cannot express to you what my
feeling was for her. Love, admiration&mdash;these seem cold
words: worship, Lesley, expresses more nearly what I felt!
Can you wonder that I hasten to welcome her daughter to
her home?"</p>

<p>Lesley's innocent heart warmed to the new-comer at
once. How unjust she had been, she thought, to shrink
for a moment from the visitor because of her youthful and
ultra-fashionable appearance. Had she not found a friend?&mdash;a
woman who loved her mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine saw the impression that she had made,
and did not try to deepen it just then. She went on more
lightly:</p>

<p>"I am a widow, you know, and I live in Russell Square.
I hope that you will come and see me sometimes. Drop
in whenever you like, and if there is anything that I can
do for you count on me. You will want to go shopping
or making calls sometimes when Miss Brooke is too busy
to take you; then you must come to me. And how was
dear Lady Alice when you saw her last?"</p>

<p>Lesley did not like these effusive expressions of affection.
But she answered, gently&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mamma was quite well, thank you." Which answer
did not give Mrs. Romaine all the information that she
desired.</p>

<p>"I have been looking at a pretty poodle dog over the
way," she went on, conscious of some desire to change the
subject. "Its mistress has been putting it through all
sorts of tricks&mdash;ah, there it is again!"</p>

<p>"The Kenyons' dog?" said Mrs. Romaine, smiling, as
she looked at the little group which had once more formed
itself upon the balcony. "Oh, I see. That is young Mr.
Kenyon, the doctor, a great friend of your father's; and
that is his sister, Ethel Kenyon, the actress."</p>

<p>"My father spoke about her," said Lesley.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he admires her very much. He wrote a long
article about her in the <i>Tribune</i> once. Do you see the
<i>Tribune</i> regularly? Your dear father writes a great deal<a name="Page_67"></a>
for it, and I am sure you must appreciate his exquisite
writing."</p>

<p>"Do you know Miss Kenyon too?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know her very well. And I expect to know
her better very soon, because I suppose we shall be connections
before long."</p>

<p>Lesley looked a smiling inquiry.</p>

<p>"I have a younger brother&mdash;my brother Oliver," said
Mrs. Romaine, with a little laugh; "and younger brothers,
dear, have a knack of falling in love. He has fallen in love
with Ethel, who is really a nice girl, as well as a pretty
and a clever girl, and I believe they will be married by
and by."</p>

<p>Lesley could not have said why, but somehow at that
moment she was distinctly glad of the fact.<a name="Page_68"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">OLIVER'S INTENTIONS.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">"Well</span>, what is she like?" Oliver Trent asked, lightly, of
his sister Rosalind, when they met that evening at dinner.</p>

<p>"Lesley Brooke? She is a handsome girl," said Mrs. Romaine,
with some reserve of manner.</p>

<p>"Nothing more?"</p>

<p>His sister waited until the servant had left the room
before she replied.</p>

<p>"I wish you would be discreet, Oliver. My servants are
often at the Brookes' with messages. I should not like
them to repeat what you were saying."</p>

<p>Oliver shrugged his shoulders with the air of a man to
whom women's caprices are incomprehensible. But he
was silent until dessert was placed upon the table, and
Mrs. Romaine's neat parlor-maid had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "you can disburthen your mind in
peace."</p>

<p>"Oliver," said Mrs. Romaine, abruptly. "I want you
to make Miss Brooke's acquaintance as soon as you can.
I don't understand her, and I think that you can help
me."</p>

<p>"As how!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be silly. You always get on with girls, and
you can tell me what you think of her."</p>

<p>Oliver raised his eyebrows, took a peach from the dish
before him, and began to peel it with great deliberation.</p>

<p>"Handsome, you say?"</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"Like Lady Alice? I remember her; a willowy, shadowy
creature, with a sort of ethereal loveliness which
appealed very strongly to my imagination when I was a
boy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine flushed a little. It occurred to her that
<i>she</i> had never been called shadowy or ethereal-looking.</p>

<p>"She is much more substantial than Lady Alice," she
said, drily. "I should say that she had more individuality<a name="Page_69"></a>
about her. She looks to me like a girl of character and
intellect."</p>

<p>"In which case your task will be the more difficult, you
mean?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean by a task. I have not
set myself to do anything definite."</p>

<p>"No? Then you are very unlike your sex, Rosalind.
I generally find women much too definite&mdash;damnably
so."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I must be an exception. You are always
trying to entrap me into damaging admissions, Oliver, and
I won't put up with it. All that I want is to be sure that
Lady Alice shall not return to her husband. But there is
nothing definite in that."</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing at all," said Oliver, satirically. "All that
you have got to do is to prejudice father and daughter
against each other as much as possible, make Brooke believe
that the girl has been set against him by her mother,
and persuade Miss Brooke that her father is not the sort of
man that Lady Alice can return to. Nothing definite in
that, is there?"</p>

<p>"Oliver, you are quite too bad. I never made any
plans of the kind." But there was a distinctly guilty look
in Mrs. Romaine's soft eyes. "Besides, that is a piece of
work which hardly needs doing. Father and daughter are
too much alike to get on."</p>

<p>"Alike, are they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in a sense. The girl is very like her mother, too&mdash;she
has Lady Alice's features and figure, but the expression
of her face is her father's. And her eyes and her
brow are her father's. And she is like her father&mdash;I think&mdash;in
disposition."</p>

<p>"You have found out so much that I think you scarcely
need me to interview her in order to tell you more. What
do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"I want to find out more about Lady Alice. Could you
not get Ethel Kenyon to ask her about her mother, and
then persuade Ethel to tell you?"</p>

<p>"Can't take <i>Ethel</i> into our confidence," said Oliver
with a disparaging emphasis upon the name. "She is such
a little fool." And then he began to roll a cigarette for
himself.<a name="Page_70"></a></p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine watched him thoughtfully for a minute or
two. "Noll," she said at length, "I thought you were
really fond of Ethel?"</p>

<p>Oliver's eyes were fixed upon the cigarette that he was
now lighting, and, perhaps, that was the reason why he
did not answer for a minute or two. At last, he said, in
his soft, drawling way&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am very fond of Ethel. And especially of the twenty
thousand pounds that her uncle left her."</p>

<p>"Ethel Kenyon is handsome enough to be loved for
something beside her money."</p>

<p>"Handsome? Oh, she's good-looking enough: but she's
not exactly to my taste. A little too showy, too abrupt
for me. Personally I like a softer, quieter woman; but as
a rule the women that I really admire haven't got twenty
thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"I know who would suit you," said Mrs. Romaine,
leaning forward and speaking in a very low voice&mdash;"Lesley
Brooke."</p>

<p>"What is her fortune? If it's a case of her face is her
fortune, she really won't do for me, Rosy, however suitable
she might be in other respects."</p>

<p>"But," said Mrs. Romaine, eagerly, "she is sure to have
plenty of money. Her father is well off&mdash;better off than
people know&mdash;and would probably settle a considerable
sum upon her; then think of the Courtleroys&mdash;there is a
fair amount of wealth in that family, surely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which they would be so very likely to give her if she
married me," said her brother, with irony. "Moonshine,
my dear. Do you think that Lady Alice would allow her
daughter to marry your brother?&mdash;knowing what she does,
and hating you as she does, would she like to be connected
with you by marriage?"</p>

<p>"That is exactly why I wish that you would marry her,"
said Mrs. Romaine, almost below her breath. "Think of
the triumph for me!"</p>

<p>Her eyes glowed, and she breathed more quickly as she
spoke. "That woman scorned me&mdash;gloated over my sorrow
and my love," she said; "she dared to reproach me
for what she called my want of modesty&mdash;my want of
womanly feeling, and&mdash;oh, I cannot tell you what she said!
But this I know, that if I could reach her through her
daughter or her husband, and stab her to the heart as she<a name="Page_71"></a>
once stabbed me, the dearest wish of my life would be fulfilled!"</p>

<p>"Women are always vindictive," said Oliver, philosophically.
"The fact is, you want to revenge yourself on Lady
Alice through me, and yet you don't consider <i>me</i> in the
very least. If I married this Lesley Brooke, Lady Alice
and all the Courtleroys would no doubt get into an awful
rage with her and you and me and everybody; and what
would be the upshot? Why, they would cut her off with
a shilling and we should be next door to penniless. Then
Brooke&mdash;well, he may be fairly prosperous, but he has
only what he makes, you know; and I doubt if he could
settle very much upon his daughter, even if he wanted to.
And he does not like me. I doubt whether even <i>you</i>, my
dear Rosy, could dispose him to look favorably on my
advances."</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine was perhaps convinced, but she did not
like to own herself mistaken. She was silent for a minute
or two, and then said with a sigh and a smile&mdash;</p>

<p>"You may be right. But it would have been splendid
if you could have married Lesley Brooke. We should have
been thorns in Lady Alice's side ever afterwards."</p>

<p>"You are one already, aren't you?" asked Oliver. He
got up from the table and approached the mantelpiece as
if to show that the discussion was ended. "No, my dear
Rosalind," he said, "I'm booked. I am going to woo and
wed Miss Ethel Kenyon and her twenty thousand pounds.
She will be sick of her fad for the stage in twelve months.
And then we shall live very comfortably. But I'll tell you
what I will do to please you. I'll <i>flirt</i> with this Lesley
girl, nineteen to the dozen. I'll make love to her: I'll win
her young affections, and do my best to break her heart, if
you like. How would that suit you?"</p>

<p>He spoke with a smile, but Rosalind knew that there was
a ring of serious earnest in his voice.</p>

<p>"It sounds a very cold-blooded sort of thing to do," she
said.</p>

<p>"Please yourself. I won't do it, then."</p>

<p>"Oh, Oliver&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you would like to see Lady Alice's daughter
pining away for love of me," said Oliver, with a little
laugh. "It is not a bad idea. The difficulty will be to
manage both girls&mdash;seriously, Rosalind, Ethel Kenyon is
the girl I mean to marry."<a name="Page_72"></a></p>

<p>"You are clever enough for anything if you like."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Well, I'll see how far I can go."</p>

<p>"I must tell you, first, however," said Mrs. Romaine,
with some hesitation, "that I told Lesley Brooke this
afternoon that you were in love with Ethel. I had not
thought of this plan, you see, Oliver."</p>

<p>"Ah, that complicates matters. Still, I think that we
can manage&mdash;after a little reflection," said her brother,
quietly. "Leave me to think it over, and I'll let you know
what to do. And now I'm going out."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Why should you ask? Do I generally tell you where
I am going? Well, if you particularly want to know, I am
going to the Novelty Theatre."</p>

<p>"To see Ethel act?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;her part will be over by the time I get there. I
shall probably see her home."</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine made no remonstrance. If she thought
her brother's conduct a trifle heartless, she did not venture
to say so. She was sometimes considerably in awe of
Oliver, although he was only a younger brother.</p>

<p>She went into the drawing-room rather slowly, watching
him as he put on his hat and overcoat in the hall.</p>

<p>"There is one thing I meant to tell you to-night, but I
forgot it until now," she said, pausing at the drawing-room
door. "I am nearly sure that I saw Francis in the Square
to-day."</p>

<p>Oliver turned round quickly. "The deuce you did! Did
he see <i>you</i>?&mdash;did he try to speak to you?"</p>

<p>"No, but I think that he is lying in wait. You made me
promise to tell you when I saw him next."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. I won't have him bothering you for
money. If he wants money he had better come to me."</p>

<p>"Have you so much, Noll?"</p>

<p>He frowned and turned away. "At any rate he is not
to annoy you," he said. "And I shall tell him so."</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine made no objection. This ne'er-do-weel
brother of hers&mdash;Francis by name&mdash;had always been a
trouble and perplexity to her. He had been in the habit
of appealing periodically to her for help, and she had seldom
failed to respond to the appeal, although she believed
that all the money she gave him went for gambling debt or
drink; but lately Oliver had interfered. He had said that<a name="Page_73"></a>
Francis must henceforth apply to him and not to Rosalind
if he wanted help, which sounded kind and brotherly
enough; but Rosalind had a vague suspicion that there
was more than met the ear in this declaration. She fancied
somehow, that Oliver had secret and special reasons for
preventing Francis' applications to her. But she knew
very well that it was useless to ask questions or to make
surmises respecting Oliver's motives and actions, unless he
chose to show a readiness to make them clear to her. So
she let him go out of the house without further remark.</p>

<p>As Oliver crossed the road, he noticed that a man was
leaning against the iron railings of the green enclosure in
the middle of the Square. The man's form was in shadow,
but his face seemed to be turned to Mrs. Romaine's house.
Oliver sedulously averted his eyes and hailed a passing
hansom cab. He had no mind to be delayed just then,
and he was almost certain that he recognized in that gaunt
and shabby figure his disreputable brother. No, by-and-bye
he would talk to Francis, he said to himself, but not
to-night. He had other game in view on this particular
evening in September.</p>

<p>The Novelty Theatre was just then occupied by a company
that claimed to be the interpreters of a Scandinavian
play-writer whose dramatic poems were just then the talk
of London. Ethel Kenyon was playing a very minor part&mdash;a
smaller <i>r&ocirc;le</i>, indeed, than she was generally supposed
to take, but one which she had accepted simply as an expression
of her enthusiastic admiration for the author.
Oliver knew the state of mind in which she generally came
away from the representation of this play, and counted on
her bright and elevated mood as a help to him in the course
he meant to pursue.</p>

<p>He knew her habits as well as he knew her moods. For
the last three years, ever since Rosalind had settled in
London, and he had been able to cultivate Miss Kenyon's
acquaintance, he had watched her blossom from a saucy,
laughing girl into a very attractive woman. It was only
during the past few months, however, that he had thought
of her as his future wife&mdash;only since she had succeeded to
that enticing legacy of twenty thousand pounds. Since
then he had studied her more carefully than ever.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian writer's play was always over by a
quarter to ten o'clock, and was succeeded by another in<a name="Page_74"></a>
which Ethel had no share. She never stayed longer than
was necessary on these nights. She was generally ready
to leave the theatre soon after ten o'clock with her companion,
Mrs. Durant, who had the right of entry to her dressing-room,
and generally acted as her dresser. Maurice
Kenyon had refused to let his sister go upon the stage unless
she was always most carefully chaperoned. Mrs.
Durant was always at hand whenever Ethel went to the
Novelty Theatre. And Oliver knew exactly what to expect
when he took up his position&mdash;not for the first time&mdash;at
the narrow little stage-door.</p>

<p>It was after ten o'clock, and the moon had risen in an
almost cloudless sky. Even London looked beautiful beneath
its light. Oliver cast a glance towards it and nodded
as if in satisfaction. He did not care for the moon one
jot; but he held a theory that women, being more romantic,
were more likely to say "yes" to a wooer than "no,"
where they were wooed beneath a moonlit sky. The
chances were all in his favor, he said to himself.</p>

<p>A cab was already waiting. Presently the door opened
and a young lady in hood and cloak came out. The light
fell on a delicate, piquante face, with a complexion of ivory
fairness which cosmetics had not had time to destroy, with
charming scarlet lips, long-lashed dark eyes, a dimpled
chin, and a great quantity of curling dark hair&mdash;the kind
of hair which will not lie straight, but twists itself into
tight rings, and gets into apparently inextricable tangles,
and looks pretty all the time. And this was Ethel Kenyon.
Her companion, a woman of forty-five, staid and demure,
followed close behind her, giving no sign of surprise when
Oliver raised his hat and gently accosted the two ladies.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Miss Kenyon. Good-evening, Mrs.
Durant: I hope you notice what a lovely evening it is!"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do!" said Ethel, fervently. "Oh, how I wish
I were in the country! I should like a long country
walk."</p>

<p>"Would not a town walk do as well, for once?" asked
Oliver, in his most persuasive tones. "I was wondering
whether you would consent to let me see you home, as it
is such a lovely night. But I see you have a cab&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would rather drive, I must say," remarked Mrs.
Durant. It was what she knew she was expected to say,
and she was not sorry for it, "I am tired of being on my<a name="Page_75"></a>
feet so long. But if you would like to walk, Ethel, I daresay
Mr. Trent would escort you."</p>

<p>"I should be only too pleased," said Oliver.</p>

<p>Ethel laughed happily. "All right, Mrs. Durant. You
drive, and I'll walk home with Mr. Trent."</p>

<p>She scarcely waited for Oliver to offer his arm. She laid
her hand in it so naturally, so securely, that even Oliver felt
an impulse of pleasure. He looked down at the lovely,
smiling creature at his side with admiration, even with
tenderness.</p>

<p>At first they did not speak much, for they had to pass
through some crowded and ill-smelling thoroughfares, where
conversation was almost impossible. By-and-bye they
emerged from these into Holborn, and thence they made
their way into the wider streets and airier squares which
abound in the West Central district. When they came in
sight of the white pillars and paved yard of the British
Museum, they were deep in talk on all sorts of matters&mdash;"Shakespeare
and the musical glasses," as Oliver afterwards
laughingly remarked. But he did not choose that
she should altogether guide the course of conversation.
Now and then he took the reins into his own hands. And
it amused him to see how readily she allowed him to direct
matters. She responded to the slightest hint, was attentive
to the least check. Such quickness of apprehension, he
argued, meant only one thing in a woman: not intellectual
faculty, but love.</p>

<p>"And you still like the stage?" he said to her, after a
time.</p>

<p>"I like it immensely. I can express myself there as I
could in no other sphere of life. People used to advise me
to take to recitations: how glad I am that I stood out
for what I liked best."</p>

<p>"What one likes best is not always the safest path."</p>

<p>"You might as well say it is not always the easiest path!
Mine is a very hard life, so far as work is concerned, you
know. I toil early and late. But how can you be so awfully
trite, Mr. Trent? I did not expect it of you."</p>

<p>"A good deal of life is rather trite," said Oliver. "I
know only one thing that can preserve it from commonplaceness
and dullness and dreariness."</p>

<p>"And that is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Love."<a name="Page_76"></a></p>

<p>A little silence fell on both of them. Oliver's voice had
sunk almost to a whisper: Ethel's cheeks had grown suddenly
very hot.</p>

<p>"Love makes everything easy and beautiful. Does not
your poet say so&mdash;the man whose play you have acted in
to-night? Ethel, why don't you try the experiment?&mdash;the
experiment of loving?"</p>

<p>"I do try it," she said, laughing, and trying to regain
her lost lightness of tone. "I love Maurice and Mrs. Durant
and hosts of people."</p>

<p>"Add one more to the list," said Oliver. "Love <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"You?" she said, doubtingly. "I am not sure whether
you are a person to be loved."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I am. Seriously, Ethel, may I speak to your
brother? May I hope that you can love me a little, and
that you will some day be my wife?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that is <i>very</i> serious!" she said, mockingly. And
she withdrew her fingers from his arm. "I did not bargain
for so much solemnity when I set out with you from
the theatre to-night."</p>

<p>"But I set out, Ethel, with the intention of asking you
to be my wife. Come, my darling, won't you give me an
answer? Don't send me away disconsolate! Let me
teach you what love means&mdash;love and happiness!"</p>

<p>His voice sank once more to its lowest murmur. Ethel
listened, hesitated, smiled. Her little fingers found their way
back to his arm again, and were instantly caught and
pressed, and even kissed, when they came to a dark and
shady place. And before he parted with her at the door
of her brother's house, he had put his arms round her and
kissed her on the lips.</p>

<p>Was it all pretence&mdash;all for the sake of those twenty
thousand pounds of hers? Oliver swore to himself that it
was not. She was such a pretty little thing&mdash;such a dear,
loving little girl, in spite of her fun and merriment and
spirit&mdash;one could not help feeling fond of her. Not that
he was going to acknowledge himself capable of such a
weakness when he next talked to Rosalind.</p>

<p>He was strolling idly along the east side of Russell
Square as these thoughts passed through his mind. He
had completely forgotten the stroller whom he had seen
leaning against the railings of the Square gardens; but he
was unpleasantly reminded of that gentleman's existence<a name="Page_77"></a>
when a hand was laid upon his shoulder, and a voice said
in his ear&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've been waiting here six hours, Oliver, and I must
have a word or two with you."<a name="Page_78"></a></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">THE ELDER BROTHER.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Oliver</span> turned round sharply, with an air of visible impatience.
He knew the voice well enough, and the moon-light
left him no doubt as to the lineaments of a face with
which he was quite familiar. Francis Trent was not unlike
either Rosalind or Oliver; but of the two he resembled his
sister rather than his younger brother. True, he did not
possess her beauty, but he had her sleepy eyes, her type
of feature, her colorless skin, and jetty hair. The colorlessness
had degenerated, however, into an unhealthy
pallor, and the stubbly beard which covered his cheeks and
chin did not improve his appearance. Besides he was
terribly out at elbows; his coat was green with age, his
boots were broken, and his cuffs frayed and soiled. His
hat was unnaturally shiny, and dented in two or three
places. Altogether he looked as unlike a brother of the
immaculate Oliver and the exquisitely-dressed Rosalind as
could possibly have been found for either in the world of
London.</p>

<p>Oliver surveyed him with polite disgust, and waved him
back a little.</p>

<p>"You have been drinking coarse brandy, Francis," he
said, coolly; "and you have been smoking bad tobacco.
I wish you would consult my susceptibilities on those
points when you come to interview me. You would really
find it pleasanter in the end."</p>

<p>"Where am I to find the money to consult your susceptibilities
with?" asked the man, with a burst of what
seemed like very genuine feeling. "Will you provide me
with it? If you don't, what remains for me but to <a name="tn_83"></a><!-- TN: "brink" changed to "drink"-->drink
British brandy and smoke strong shag? I must drink
something&mdash;I must smoke something. Will you pay the
piper if I go to more expense?"</p>

<p>"Not if you talk so loudly as to attract the attention of
every passing policeman," said Oliver, dryly. "If you<a name="Page_79"></a>
want to talk to me, as you say you do, keep quiet please."</p>

<p>Francis Trent growled something like an imprecation
on his brother below his breath, and then went on in a
lowered tone.</p>

<p>"It's easy for you to talk. You are not saddled by a
wife and a lot of debts. <i>You</i> haven't to keep out of the
way for fear you should be wanted by the police&mdash;although
you have not been very particular about keeping
your hands clean after all. But you've been the lucky
dog and I the unlucky one, and this is the result."</p>

<p>"If you are going to be abusive, my good friend," said
Oliver, calmly, "I shall turn round and go home again.
If you will keep a civil tongue in your head I don't mind
listening to you for five minutes. What have you got to
say?"</p>

<p>The man was evidently in a state of only half-repressed
irritation. His brows twitched, he gnawed savagely at
his beard, he looked at Oliver with furtive hate from
under his heavy dark brows. But the younger man's cool
tones seemed to possess the power of keeping him in
check. He made a visible effort to calm himself as he
replied,</p>

<p>"You needn't be so down on me, Oliver. You must
allow for a fellow's feeling a little out of sorts when he's
kept waiting about here for hours. I am convinced that
Rosalind saw me this afternoon; I'm certain that you saw
me to-night. If I had not caught you now I would have
gone to the front door and hammered at it till one of you
came out."</p>

<p>"And you think that you would have advanced your
cause thereby?"</p>

<p>"Why, hang it all, Oliver, one would think that I was
not your own flesh and blood! Have you no natural
affection left?"</p>

<p>"Not much. Natural affection is a mistake. You need
not count on that with me."</p>

<p>"You always were a cold-blooded, half-hearted sort of
a fellow. Not one to help a friend, or even a brother,"
said Francis, sullenly.</p>

<p>"Suppose you come to the point," remarked Oliver.
"It is getting on to eleven o'clock. I really can't stand
here all night."</p>

<p>"It is nothing to you that I have stood here for hours
already."<a name="Page_80"></a></p>

<p>"No, it is not." There was a touch of sharpness in his
tone. "I am in no mood for sentiment. Say what you
have to say and get done with it, or I shall leave you."</p>

<p>"Well," said Francis, after a pause, in which he was
perhaps estimating his own powers of persuasion against
his brother's powers of resistance, and coming to the conclusion
that it was not worth his while to contend with him
any longer, "I have come to say this. I am hard up&mdash;devilish
hard up. But that's not all. It is not enough to
offer me a five-pound note or a ten-pound note and tell me
to spend it as I please. I want something definite. You
seem to have plenty of money: I have none. I want an
allowance, or else a sum of money down, sufficient to take
Mary and myself to the Colonies. I don't think that is
much to ask."</p>

<p>"Don't you?"</p>

<p>The icy tone which Oliver assumed exasperated his
brother.</p>

<p>"No, be hanged if I think it is!" he said vehemently,
though still in lowered tones. "I want two hundred a
year&mdash;it's little enough: or two or three thousand on the
nail. Give me that, and I'll not trouble you or Rosy any
more."</p>

<p>"And where do you suppose that I'm to get two or
three thousand pounds, or two hundred a year?"</p>

<p>"I don't care where you get it, so long as you hand it
over to me."</p>

<p>"Very sorry I can't oblige you," said Oliver, nonchalantly
"but as your proposition is a perfect impossibility,
I don't see my way to saying anything else."</p>

<p>"You think I don't mean it, do you?" growled his
brother. "I tell you that I will have it. And if I don't
have it I'll not hold my tongue any longer. I'll ruin you."</p>

<p>"Don't talk in that melodramatic way," said Oliver,
quietly. But his lip twitched a little as if something had
touched him unpleasantly. "You know very well that
you have no more power of ruining me than you have of
flying to yonder moon. You can't substantiate any of
your stories. You can blacken me in the eyes of a few
persons who know me, perhaps; but really I doubt your
power of doing that. People wouldn't believe you, you
know; and they would believe me. There is so much
moral power in a good hat and patent leather boots."<a name="Page_81"></a></p>

<p>"Do you dare to trifle with me&mdash;&mdash;" the man was beginning,
furiously, but Oliver checked him with a slight
pressure on his arm, and went on suavely.</p>

<p>"All this threatening sort of business is out of date, as
you ought to know. One would think that you had been
to the Surrey-side Theatres, lately, or the Porte St. Martin,
and taken lessons of a stage villain. 'Beware! I will be
revenged,' and all that sort of thing. It doesn't go down
now, you know. The fact is this&mdash;you can't do me any
harm, you can only harm yourself; and I think you had
better be advised by me and hold your tongue."</p>

<p>Francis was silent for a minute or two. He was evidently
impressed by Oliver's manner.</p>

<p>"You're right in one way," he said, in a much more
subdued tone. "People wouldn't listen to me because I
am so badly dressed&mdash;I look so poor. But that could be
remedied. A new suit of clothes might make all the difference,
Oliver. And then we could see whether <i>some</i> people
would believe me or not!"</p>

<p>"And what difference will it make to me if people did
believe you?" said Oliver, slowly.</p>

<p>The man stared at him open-mouthed. Oliver was taking
a view of things which was unknown to Francis.</p>

<p>"Well," he answered, "considering that you and most
of my relations and friends have cut me for the last ten
years because I got into trouble over a few accounts at
the bank&mdash;and considering the sorry figure I cut now in
consequence&mdash;I don't know why you should be so careless
of the possibility of partaking my downfall! I should say
that it would be rather worse for you than it has been for
me; and it hasn't been very nice for <i>me</i>, I can assure
you!"</p>

<p>Oliver's face grew a trifle paler, but his voice was as
smooth as ever when he began to speak.</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Francis," he said, "I'll be open and
plain with you. Of course, I know what you are alluding
to; it would be weakness to pretend that I did not. But
I assure you that you are on the wrong track. In your
case you were found to have embezzled money, falsified
accounts, and played the devil with old Lawson's affairs
generally. You were prosecuted for it, and the whole case
was in the papers. You got off on some technical point,
but everybody knew that you were guilty, and everybody<a name="Page_82"></a>
cut you dead&mdash;except, you will remember, your brother
and sister, who continued to give you money, and were
exceedingly kind to you. You were publicly disgraced,
and there was no way of hushing the matter up at all. I
am sorry to be obliged to put things so disagreeably&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on! You needn't apologize," said Francis, with a
rather husky laugh. "I know it all as well as you do.
Go on."</p>

<p>"I wish to point out the difference between our positions,"
said Oliver, calmly. "I did something a little
shady myself, when I was a lad of twenty&mdash;at your instigation,
mind; I signed old Romaine's name in the wrong
place, didn't I? Old Romaine found it out, kept the thing
quiet, and said that he had given me the money. I expressed
my regret, and the matter blew over. What can
you make out of that story?"</p>

<p>He spoke very quietly, but there was a watchfulness in
his eye, a slight twitching of his nostril, which proved him
to be not entirely at his ease. His elder brother laughed
aloud.</p>

<p>"If that were all!" he said. "But you forget how
base the action would seem if all the circumstances were
known! how black the treachery and ingratitude to a man
who was, after all, your benefactor. Rosalind never knew
of that little episode, I believe? And she has a good deal
of respect for her husband's memory. I should like to see
what she would say about it."</p>

<p>"She would not believe you, my dear boy."</p>

<p>"But if I could prove it? If I had in my possession a
full confession signed by yourself&mdash;the confession that
Romaine insisted on, you will remember? What effect
would that have upon her mind? And there was that
other business, you know, about Mary's sister, whom you
lured away from her home and ruined. <i>She</i> is dead, but
Mary is alive and can bear witness against you. How
would you like these facts blazoned abroad and brought
home to the mind of the pretty girl whom I saw you kissing
a little while ago on the steps of a house in Upper
Woburn Place? She is a Miss Kenyon, I know: an
actress; I have heard all about her. Her brother is a
doctor; and she has twenty thousand pounds in her own
right."</p>

<p>"You do seem, indeed, to know everything," said Oliver,
with a sneer.<a name="Page_83"></a></p>

<p>"I make it my business to know everything about you.
You've been so confoundedly mean of late that I had begun
to understand that I must put the screw on you. And
I warn you, if you don't give me what I ask, or promise
to do so within a reasonable time, I shall first go to Rosalind,
and then to these Kenyon people, and Caspar
Brooke, and all these other friends of yours, and see what
they will give me for your secrets."</p>

<p>"They'll kick you out of the house, and you'll be called
a fool for your pains," said the younger man, furiously.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so. Not if I play my game properly.
You are engaged to Miss Kenyon, are you not?"
Oliver stood silent.</p>

<p>"I tell you that she shall never marry you in ignorance
of your past unless you shut my mouth first. And you
are the best judge of whether she will marry you at all or
not, when she knows what we know."</p>

<p>Then the two brothers were both silent for a little while.
Oliver stood frowning, tracing a pattern on the pavement
with the toe of his polished boot, and gazing at it. He
was evidently considering the situation. Francis stood
with his back to the railings, his eyes fixed, with a somewhat
crafty look, upon his brother's face. He was not yet
sure that his long-cherished scheme for extracting money
from Oliver would succeed. He believed that it would;
but there was never any counting upon Oliver. Astute as
Francis considered himself (in spite of his failure in the
world), Oliver was astuter still.</p>

<p>Presently Oliver looked up and met Francis' fixed gaze.
He started a little, and made an odd grimace, intended to
conceal a nervous twitch of the muscles of his face. Then
he spoke.</p>

<p>"You think yourself very clever, no <a name="tn_88"></a><!-- TN: Comma changed to period after "doubt"-->doubt. Well,
perhaps you are. I'll acknowledge that, in a certain
sense, you might spoil my game for me. Not quite in
the way you think, you know; but up to a certain point.
As I don't want to have my game spoilt, I am willing to
make a bargain with you&mdash;is that plain?"</p>

<p>"Fair sailing, so far," said Francis, doggedly. "Go on.
What will you give?"</p>

<p>"Nothing just now. The sum you named on the day
when I marry Ethel Kenyon, on condition that you give
me back that confession you talk about, swear not to mention
your wife's sister, and take yourself off to Australia."<a name="Page_84"></a></p>

<p>"Hm!" said Francis considering. "So I have brought
you to terms, have <a name="tn_89a"></a><!--TN: Quote removed after "I?"-->I? So much the better for you&mdash;and
perhaps for me. Are you engaged to Miss Kenyon?"</p>

<p>"I asked her to-night to marry me, and she consented."</p>

<p>"You always were a lucky dog, Oliver," said Francis,
with almost a wistful expression on his crafty face. "I
never could see how you managed it, for my part. If that
pretty girl"&mdash;with a laugh&mdash;"knew all that I knew&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly. I don't want her to know all you do. Are
you going to agree to my terms or not?"</p>

<p>"I should have said they were <i>my</i> terms," said the elder
brother, "but we won't haggle about names. Say two
thousand five hundred pounds down?"</p>

<p>"No, two thousand," said Oliver, boldly. "That will
suit me better than two hundred a year."</p>

<p>"Ah, you want to get rid of me, don't you? How soon
is it likely to be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that I can't tell you. As soon as she fixes the
day."</p>

<p>"I swear by all that I hold sacred," said Francis, with
sudden energy, "that I won't wait more than six months,
and then I'll take two thousand."</p>

<p>"Six? Make it twelve. The girl may want a year's
freedom."</p>

<p>"I won't wait twelve. I swear I won't. I'm tired of
this life. I can't get any work to do, though I've tried
over and over again. And I'm always unlucky at play.
There's Mary threatening to go out to work again. If we
were in another country, with a clear start, she should not
have to do that."</p>

<p>Oliver meditated. It did not seem to him likely that
Ethel would refuse to marry him in six months' time, but
of course it was possible. Still he was pretty sure that he
could get the money advanced as soon as his engagement
was noised abroad. It was rather a pity that he would
have to publish it so soon&mdash;especially when his projects
respecting Lesley Brooke had not been carried out&mdash;but
it could not be helped. The prospect of ridding himself
of his brother Francis was most welcome to him. And&mdash;if
he could quiet him by promises, it might perhaps not be
necessary to pay him the money after all.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, at last, "I promise it within six months,
Francis. On the conditions I named, of course."<a name="Page_85"></a></p>

<p>"And you will keep your word?" said Francis, looking
suspiciously into his brother's smooth, pale face.</p>

<p>"If not," answered Oliver, airily, "you have the remedy
in your own hands, you know. You can easily bring me
to book. And now that this interesting conversation is
ended, perhaps you will kindly allow me to go home? The
night is fine, but I am a good deal chilled with standing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And what am I, then? I've been waiting for you, off
and on, for hours. And I haven't got a shilling in my
pocket, either. Haven't you got a pound or two to spare,
Oliver? For the sake of old times, you know."</p>

<p>Some men would have found it pitiful to hear poor
Francis Trent, with his broken-down, cringing, crafty look,
thus sueing for a sovereign. For he had the air of a ruined
gentleman, not of an ordinary beggar, and the signs of
refinement in his face and bearing made his state of abasement
and destitution more apparent. But Oliver was not
touched by any such sentimental considerations. He
looked at first as if he were about to refuse his brother's
request; but policy dictated another course. He must not
drive to desperation the man in whose hands lay his character
and perhaps his future fortune. He put his hand
into his pocket, brought out a couple of sovereigns, and
dropped them into Francis' greedily outstretched palm.
Then he crossed the road towards his sister's house, while
the elder brother slunk away with an air of anything but
triumph. It was sad to see him so depressed, so broken-spirited,
so hopeless. For he had been meant for better
things. But his will was weak, his principles had never
been settled, and with his first lapse from honesty all self-respect
seemed to leave him. Thenceforth he went down
hill, and would long ago have reached the bottom but for
the one helping hand that had been held out to stay him
in his mad career. That hand belonged to none of his
kith and kin, however. It was seamed and roughened and
reddened by honest toil; but the toil had at least been
honest and the toiler's love for the fine gentleman for whom
she worked was loving and sincere. To cut a long story
short, Francis Trent had married a dressmaker of the
lower grade, and a dressmaker, moreover, who had once
been a ladies'-maid.</p>

<p>While he slouched away to his poverty-stricken home,
and Oliver solaced himself with a novel and a cigar, and<a name="Page_86"></a>
Miss Ethel Kenyon sank to sleep in spite of a tumult of
innocent delight which would have kept a person of less
healthy mind and body wide awake for hours, Lesley
Brooke, who was to influence the fate of all these three,
lay upon her bed bemoaning her loneliness of heart, and
saying to herself that she should never be happy in her
father's house. It was not that she had met with any
positive unkindness: she could accuse nobody of wishing
to be rude or cold, but the atmosphere was not one to
which she was accustomed, and it gave her considerable
discomfort. Even the Mrs. Romaine of whom her father
spoke as if she would be a friend, was not very congenial
to her. Rosalind's eyes remained cold, despite their softness,
and Lesley was vaguely conscious of a repulsion&mdash;such
as we sometimes feel on touching a toad or a snake&mdash;when
Mrs. Romaine put her hand on the girl's listless
fingers. No, what it was Lesley could not tell, but she was
sure of this, that she could never like Mrs. Romaine.</p>

<p>And she cried herself to sleep, and dreamed of the convent
and the sunny skies of France.<a name="Page_87"></a></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">KNIGHT-ERRANTRY.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Lesley</span> found that she had unintentionally given great
offence to Sarah, who was a supreme authority in her
father's house, and possibly to her aunt as well, by the
arrangement with her father that she would have a maid
of her own. In vain she protested that she did not need
one, and had not really asked for one; the impression
remained upon Miss Brooke's mind and Sarah's mind that
she had in some way complained of the treatment which
she had received, and they were a little prejudiced against
her in consequence.</p>

<p>Miss Brooke was a good woman, and, to some extent,
a just woman; but it was scarcely possible for her to
judge Lesley correctly. All Miss Brooke's traditions
favored the cult of the woman who worked: and Lesley,
like her mother before her, had the look of a tall, fair lily&mdash;one
of those who toil not, neither do they spin. Miss
Brooke was quite too liberal-minded to have any great prejudice
against a girl because she had been educated in a
French convent, though naturally she thought it the worst
place of training that could have been secured for her; and
she had made up her mind at once, when she saw Lesley,
that although there might be "no great harm" in the poor
child, she was probably as frivolous, as shallow-hearted,
and as ignorant as the ordinary French school-girl was
supposed to be.</p>

<p>With Sarah the case was different. Sarah was an ardent
Protestant, of a strict Calvinist type, and she had taken up
the impression that Miss Lesley must needs be a Romanist.
Now this was not the case, for Lesley had always
been allowed to go to her own church, see her own clergyman,
and hold aloof from the devotional exercises prescribed
for the other girls. But Sarah believed firmly that
she belonged to the Church of Rome, and she did not feel
at all easy in her mind at staying under the same roof with<a name="Page_88"></a>
her. She made this remark to Miss Brooke on the third
day after Lesley's arrival, and was offended at the burst of
laughter with which Miss Brooke received it.</p>

<p>"Do you think the house will fall in, Sarah? or that
you will be corrupted?"</p>

<p>"I think I may hold myself safe, ma'am," said Sarah,
with dignity. "But I'm not so sure about the house."</p>

<p>She stood with her arms folded, grimly surveying her
mistress, who, if the truth must be told, was lying on a
sofa in her bedroom, smoking a cigarette. Sarah knew
her mistress' tastes, and had grown generally tolerant of
them, but she still looked on the cigarettes with disapproval.
Miss Brooke was discreet enough to smoke only in
her own room or in her brother's study&mdash;a fact which had
mollified Sarah a little when her mistress first began the
practice.</p>

<p>"The minute you smoke one o' them nasty things in the
street, ma'am, I shall give notice," she had said.</p>

<p>And Miss Brooke had quietly answered: "Very well,
Sarah, we'll wait till then."</p>

<p>It must be added, for the benefit of all who are shocked
by Miss Brooke's practice, that she had begun it by order
of a doctor as a cure for neuralgia. She continued it because
she liked it. Lesley was only just beginning to suspect
her aunt of the habit, and was inexpressibly startled
and alarmed at the thought of such a thing. That her
aunt, who was indisputably kind, clever, benevolent, respectable
in every way, should smoke cigarettes, seemed to
Lesley to justify all that she had heard against her father's
Bohemian household. She could not get over it. Sarah
<i>had</i> got over this outrage on conventionality, but she was
not yet prepared to forgive Lesley for having lived in a
French convent.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're not sure about the house," said Miss
Brooke. "Well, I'm sorry for you, Sarah. I'll send in a
plumber if you think that would be any good."</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, don't; but if it will not ill-convenience you
I should like to put a few tracts in Miss Lesley's room,
so that she may look at them sometimes instead of the
little book of Popish prayers that she has brought with
her."</p>

<p>Miss Brooke wondered for a moment what the book of
Popish prayers could be; and then remembered a little<a name="Page_89"></a>
Russia-bound book&mdash;the well-known "Imitation of Christ"
which she had noticed in Lesley's room, and which Sarah
had doubtless mistaken for a book of prayer. It would
not have been at all like Miss Brooke to clear up the mistake.
She generally let mistakes clear themselves. She
only gave one of her short, clear, rather hard laughs, and
told Sarah to put as many tracts as she pleased in Lesley's
room. Whereon, Lesley shortly afterwards found a bundle
of these publications in her room, and, as she rather disliked
their tone and tendency, she requested Sarah to take
them away.</p>

<p>"They were put there for you to read," said Sarah, with
stolid displeasure.</p>

<p>"By my aunt?"</p>

<p>"Your aunt knew that I was going to put them there.
And it would be better for you to sit and read them rather
than them rubbishy books you gets out of master's libery.
Your poor, perishing soul ought to be looked after as well
as your body."</p>

<p>"Take them away, please," said Lesley, wearily. "I do
not want to read them: I am not accustomed to that sort
of book." Then, the innate sweetness of her nature gaining
the day, she added, "Please do not be angry with me,
Sarah. I would read them if I thought that they would do
me any good, but I am afraid they will not."</p>

<p>"Just like your mother," Sarah said, sharply. "She
wouldn't touch 'em with the tips of her fingers, neither.
And a maid, and all that nonsense. And dresses from
France. Deary me, this is a sad upsetting for poor master."</p>

<p>"I don't interfere with your master," said Lesley, somewhat
bitterly. "He does not trouble about me&mdash;and I
don't see why I should trouble about him."</p>

<p>She said it almost below her breath, not thinking that
Sarah would hear or understand; but Sarah&mdash;after flouncing
out of the room with an indignant "Well, I'm sure!"&mdash;went
straight to Miss Brooke and repeated every word,
with a few embellishments of her own. Miss Brooke came
to the conclusion that Lesley was, first of all, very indiscreet
to take servants so much into her confidence, and,
secondly, that she was inclined to rebel against her father's
authority. And it seemed good to her to take counsel
with Mrs. Romaine in this emergency; and Mrs. Romaine
soon found an opportunity of pouring a sugared, poisoned
version of what she had heard into Caspar Brooke's too<a name="Page_90"></a>
credulous ears. So that he became colder than ever in his
manner to Lesley, and Lesley wondered vainly how she
could have offended him.</p>

<p>The sole comfort that she gleaned at this time came from
the Kenyons. Ethel called on her, and won her heart at
once by a peculiarly caressing winsomeness that reminded
one of some tropical bird&mdash;all dainty coquetries and shy,
sweet playfulness. Not that Ethel was in the least bit shy,
in reality; but she had a very tiny touch of the stage habit
of <i>posing</i>, and with strangers she invariably posed as being
a little shy. But in spite of this innocent little affectation,
and in spite of a very fashionable style of dress and <a name="tn_95"></a><!-- TN: "demeannor" changed to "demeanor"-->demeanor,
Ethel was true-hearted and affectionate, and Lesley's
own heart warmed to the tenderness of Ethel's nature before
she had been in her company half an hour.</p>

<p>"You know you are not a bit like what I expected you
to be," Ethel said sagely, when the two girls had talked
together for some little time.</p>

<p>"What did you expect?" said Lesley, her face <a name="tn_95a"></a><!-- TN: Period added after "aglow"-->aglow.</p>

<p>"I hardly know&mdash;something more French, I think&mdash;a
girl with airs and graces," said Ethel, who had herself more
airs and graces than Lesley had ever donned in all her life;
"nothing so Puritan as you are!"</p>

<p>"Puritan, after so many years of a French convent?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Puritan: no word suits you half so well! There
is a sort of restrained life and gladness about you, and it is
the restraint that gives it its attraction! Oh, forgive me for
speaking so frankly; but when I see you I forget that I
have not known you for years and years! I feel somehow
as if we had been friends all our life!"</p>

<p>"And so do I," said Lesley, surrendering herself to the
spell, and letting Ethel take both her hands and look into
her face. "But you are not at all like the English girls I
expected to meet! I thought they were all cold and stiff!"</p>

<p>"Have you never seen an English girl before, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I have had no English girl friend. I never
talked to an English girl before as I am talking to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, how charming!" said Ethel. "And I never before
talked to a girl who had lived in a convent! We are each
a new experience to the other! What a basis for friendship!"</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" said Lesley. "I should have
thought the opposite&mdash;that what is old and well-tried and
established is the best to found a friendship upon."<a name="Page_91"></a></p>

<p>She spoke half sadly, with a memory of her parents and
her own relations with her father in her mind. Ethel gave
her a shrewd glance, but made no direct reply. She was
a young woman of marvellously quick intuitions, and she
saw at once that Lesley's training had not fitted her to take
up her position in the Brooke household very easily.</p>

<p>When she went home she turned this matter over in her
mind a good many times; and was so absorbed in her
reflections that her brother had to ask her twice what she
was thinking about before she answered him.</p>

<p>"I was thinking about Lesley Brooke," she answered
promptly.</p>

<p>"A lively subject. I never saw a girl with a more melancholy
expression."</p>

<p>"Well, of course, as yet she hates everything," said
Ethel, comprehensively.</p>

<p>"Hates everything! That's a large order," said the
young doctor.</p>

<p>They were at dinner&mdash;they dined at six every day on
account of Ethel's professional engagements; and it was
not often that Maurice was at home. When he was at
home Ethel knew that he liked to talk to her, so she abandoned
her brown studies.</p>

<p>"Well, she hates the fog and the darkness, and the ugly
buildings and the solid furniture of Mr. Brooke's house,
which dates back to the Georgian era at the very least.
I'm sure she hates Sarah. And I shouldn't like to say that
she hates Doctor Sophy"&mdash;Ethel always called Miss
Brooke Doctor Sophy&mdash;"but she doesn't like her very
much. She is awfully shocked because Doctor Sophy
smokes cigarettes."</p>

<p>"Quite right of Miss Lesley Brooke to be shocked,"
said Maurice, laughing. "However, she need not despair,
there is always old Caspar to fall back upon."</p>

<p>Ethel <a name="tn_96"></a><!-- TN: "pursued" changed to "pursed"-->pursed up her lips, looked at her brother very
hard, and shook her curly head significantly.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," cried the doctor, "that she
doesn't appreciate her father?"</p>

<p>"I don't think she understands him. And how can she
appreciate him if she doesn't understand?"</p>

<p>Maurice laid down his knife and fork, and simply glared
at his sister. He was an excitable young man, and had a
way of expressing himself sometimes in reprehensibly
strong language. On this occasion, he said<a name="Page_92"></a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that that girl is such a born
idiot and fool that she can't see what a grand man her
father is?"</p>

<p>Ethel nodded. But her eyes brimmed over with mirth.</p>

<p>"Then she deserves to be shut up for life in the convent
she came from!" said the doctor. "I wouldn't have believed
it! Is she blind? Doesn't she <i>see</i> what an intellect
that man has? Can't she understand that his abilities are
equal to those of any man in Europe?"</p>

<p>"We all know your admiration for Mr. Brooke, dear,"
said Ethel, saucily. "You had better go and expound
your views to Lesley. Perhaps she and her father would
get on better then."</p>

<p>Maurice was silent. He sat and looked aghast at the
notion thus presented to him. That Caspar Brooke&mdash;his
friend, his mentor, almost his hero&mdash;should not have been
able to live with his wife was bad enough! That his
daughter should not admire him seemed to Maurice a sort
of profanation! Heavens, what did the girl mean? The
mother might have been an aristocratic fool; but the girl?&mdash;she
looked intelligent enough! There must be a misapprehension
somewhere; and it occurred to Maurice that it
might be his duty to remove it.</p>

<p>Maurice Kenyon was a born knight-errant. When he
said that a thing wanted doing, his heart ached until he
could do it. A Celtic strain of blood in him showed itself
in the heat of his belief, the impetuosity of his actions. In
Ethel this strain had taken an artistic turn; but the same
nature that urged her to dramatic representation urged her
brother to set to work vehemently on righting anything that
he thought was wrong. There never was a man who hated
more than he to leave a matter <i>in statu quo</i>.</p>

<p>Although Ethel said no more concerning Lesley's misunderstanding
of her father, Maurice was haunted by the echo
of her remarks. He could not conceive how a girl possessed
of ordinary faculties could possibly misprize her father's
gifts. Either she was a girl of extraordinary stupidity, or
she was wilfully blind. Perhaps there was no one to point
out to her Caspar Brooke's many virtues. But they
(thought Maurice) lay on the surface, and could not possibly
be overlooked. The girl must have been spoiled by
her residence in a French convent: she must be either
stupid, frivolous, or base. Then how could Ethel care for<a name="Page_93"></a>
her? Surely she could not be stupid: she could not be
base&mdash;she might be frivolous: Maurice could not go so far
as to think that his sister Ethel would like her the worse
for being a little frivolous. Yes, that must be it: she was
frivolous&mdash;a soulless butterfly, who pined for the gaieties
of Paris. How awfully hard for a man like Caspar Brooke
to have a daughter who was merely frivolous.</p>

<p>The more he thought of it&mdash;and he thought a good deal
of it&mdash;the more Mr. Kenyon was concerned. No doubt it
was no business of his, he said to himself, and he was a
fool to worry himself. But then Brooke was his friend, in
spite of the disparity of their years; and he did not like to
think that his friend had such a heavy burden to bear.
For, of course, it was a heavy burden to a man like Brooke.
No doubt Brooke did not show that it was a burden:
strong men did not cry out when their strength was tried.
But a man with his power of affection, his tenderness, his
depth of feeling (as Maurice thought), must be troubled
when he found that his daughter neither loved nor comprehended
him!</p>

<p>Maurice reflected that he had seen this extraordinary
girl once. She had been standing at the window one day
when he and Ethel were feeding that pampered poodle of
Ethel's, Scaramouch, and he had been struck by the grace
of her figure, the queenly pose of her head. He had not
observed her face particularly, but he believed that it was
rather pretty. Her dress&mdash;for his practised memory began
to furnish him with details&mdash;her dress was grey, and if he
could judge aright, fashionably made. Yes, a little French
fashion-plate&mdash;a doll, powdered, perhaps, and painted,
laced up, and perfumed and clothed in dainty raiment, to
come and make discord in her father's home! It was intolerable.
Why did not Brooke leave this pestilent creature
in her own abode, with the insolent, aristocratic friends
who had done their best already to spoil his life!</p>

<p>Thus he worked himself up to a high pitch of passionate
excitement on his friend's behalf. It never occurred to him
that Caspar Brooke might not at all be in need of it. It
did not seem possible to him that a father could feel indifferent
to the opinion of his child. And perhaps he was
right, and Caspar Brooke not quite so indifferent as he
seemed.</p>

<p>It must be the girl's fault, Maurice thought to himself.
Could nothing be done? Could he set Ethel to talk to<a name="Page_94"></a>
her? But no: Ethel was not serious enough in her appreciation
of Caspar Brooke. Mrs. Romaine? She would
praise Mr. Brooke, no doubt; but Kenyon had a troubled
doubt of Mrs. Romaine's motives.</p>

<p>Doctor Sophy? Well, he liked Doctor Sophy immensely,
especially since she had given up her practice: he
liked her because she was so frank, so sensible, so practical
in her dealings. But she was not a very sympathetic
sort of person: not the kind of person, he acknowledged
to himself, who would be likely to inspire a young girl with
enthusiasm for another.</p>

<p>If there was nobody else to perform a needed office, it
was your plain duty to perform it yourself. That had been
Maurice Kenyon's motto for many years. It recurred to
him now with rather disagreeable force.</p>

<p>Why, of course, <i>he</i> could not go and tell Brooke's daughter
that she was a frivolous fool! What was his conscience
driving at, he wondered. How could he, who did not
know her in the least, commit such an act of impertinence
as tell her how much he disapproved of her? It would be
the act of a prig, not of a gentleman.</p>

<p>Of course he could not do it. And then he began at the
beginning again, and condoled with Brooke in his own
heart, and vituperated Brooke's daughter, and wondered
whether she was really incapable of being reclaimed to the
paths of filial reverence, and whether he ought not to
make an attempt in his friend's favor. All of which proves
that if any man deserved the name of a Don Quixote, that
man was Maurice Kenyon, M.R.C.S.</p>

<p>Ethel unconsciously gave him the chance he secretly
desired. He wanted above all things to make Lesley's
acquaintance, and to talk to her&mdash;for her good&mdash;about her
father. And one afternoon his sister begged him, as a
great favor to her; to go over to Mr. Brooke's house with
a message and a parcel for Lesley. He had been introduced
to her one day in the street, therefore there could
be nothing strange in his going in and asking for her, Ethel
said. And would he please go about four o'clock, so as
to catch Miss Lesley Brooke at afternoon tea.</p>

<p>Maurice told himself that it would be an impertinent
thing to speak to her about her family affairs, and that he
would only stay three minutes. At four o'clock he knocked
at the door of Mr. Brooke's chocolate-brown house, and
inquired solemnly for Miss Brooke.<a name="Page_95"></a></p>

<p>Miss Brooke was not at home.</p>

<p>"Miss Lesley Brooke then?"</p>

<p>Miss Lesley Brooke was in the drawing-room. Maurice
went upstairs.<a name="Page_96"></a></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">BROOKE'S DISCIPLE.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Lesley</span> was sitting in a low chair near a small wood fire,
which the chillness of the October day made fully acceptable.
She had a book on her lap, but she did not look as
if she were reading: her chin was supported by her hand,
and her brown eyes were gazing out of the window, with,
as Maurice Kenyon could not fail to see, a slightly blank
and saddened look. The girl had been now a fortnight in
London, and her face had paled and thinned since her
arrival; there was an anxious fold between her brows, and
her mouth drooped at the corners. If her old friends&mdash;Sister
Rose of the convent, for instance&mdash;had seen her,
they could hardly have recognized this spiritless, brooding
maiden for the joyous "Lisa" of their thoughts.</p>

<p>Mr. Kenyon had only one moment in which to note the
significance of her attitude, for Lesley changed it as soon
as she heard his name. He gave her Ethel's message at
once and Ethel's parcel, and then stood, a little confused and
unready for she had risen and was looking as if, when his
errand was accomplished, he ought to go. Fortunately,
Doctor Sophy came in and invited him cordially to sit down;
rang for tea and scolded him roundly for not coming oftener;
then suddenly remembered that one of her everlasting
committees was at that moment sitting in a neighboring
house, and started off at once to join her fellows, calling
out to Lesley as she went to give Mr. Kenyon some tea,
and tell her father, who was in the library.</p>

<p>"My father is out: Aunt Sophy does not know that,"
said Lesley to her visitor.</p>

<p>"Then I ought to go?" said Maurice, smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!"&mdash;Lesley looked disturbed. "I did not
mean to be so inhospitable. The tea is just coming up."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Maurice, accepting the unspoken
invitation and seating himself. "I shall be very glad of
a cup."<a name="Page_97"></a></p>

<p>She sat down too, veiling the real embarrassment of a
school-girl by an assumption of great dignity. Maurice
looked at her and felt perplexed. Somehow he could not
believe that Brooke's daughter was such a very frivolous
girl when he came to look at her. She had a fine brow,
expressive eyes, a very eloquent mouth. He wondered
what she was reading. Glancing at the title of the book,
his heart sank within him. She had a yellow-backed novel
in her hand, of a profoundly light and frivolous type.
Maurice was fond of certain kinds of novels, but there
were others that he disliked and despised, and, as it happened,
Lesley had got hold of one of these.</p>

<p>"You are reading?" he said. "Am I interrupting you
very much?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Lesley answered, smiling and shutting the
book. "Tea is coming up, you see. I am falling into
English habits, and beginning to love the hour of tea."</p>

<p>Sarah brought in the tea-tray as she spoke; and even
Sarah's sour visage relaxed a little at the sight of the
young doctor. She went downstairs, and presently
returned with a plate of small, sweet cakes, which she
placed rather ostentatiously upon the table.</p>

<p>"Sarah must have brought those cakes especially for
me," said Mr. Kenyon lightly, when she had left the room.
"She knows they are my especial favorites. And your
father's too. I don't know how many dozen your father
and I have not eaten, with our coffee sometimes in an
evening! I suppose you are learning to like them for his
sake!"</p>

<p>He was talking against time for the sake of giving her
back the confidence that she seemed to have lost, for her
face had flushed and paled again more than once since his
entry. But perhaps he was wrong, for she answered him
with a quietness of tone which showed no perturbation.</p>

<p>"These little macaroon things, you mean? I like them
very much already. I did not know that my father cared
about them. I have been away so long"&mdash;smilingly&mdash;"that
I know but little of his tastes."</p>

<p>"I could envy you the pleasure you will have, then?"
said Maurice, quickly.</p>

<p>Lesley opened her brown eyes. "The&mdash;the pleasure?"
she faltered in an inquiring tone.<a name="Page_98"></a></p>

<p>"Yes, the pleasure of discovering what are the tastes
and feelings of a man like your father," said Maurice.</p>

<p>Then, as she looked disconcerted still, and as if she did
not know quite what he meant, he went on, ardently:</p>

<p>"You have the privilege, you know, of being the only
daughter of a man who is not only very widely known, but
very much respected and admired. That doesn't seem much
to you perhaps?"&mdash;for he thought he saw Lesley's lip curl,
and his tone became a little sharp. "I assure you it
means a great deal in a world like ours&mdash;in the world of
London. It means that your father is a man of great
ability and of unimpeachable honesty&mdash;I mean honesty of
thought, honesty of purpose&mdash;intellectual honesty. You
have no idea how rare that quality is amongst public men&mdash;or
literary men&mdash;or journalists. Indeed it is a wonder
that Brooke is so successful as he is, considering that he
never wrote or said a word that he did not mean. No doubt
that seems a small thing to you: it is not a small thing to
say of a journalist now-a-days."</p>

<p>"I don't know much about journalists," said Lesley.
"But all that you are saying would be taken as a matter of
course amongst <i>gentlemen</i>."</p>

<p>There was a snub for Maurice, and a sly hit at her father,
too. Maurice began to wax warm.</p>

<p>"Miss Brooke," he said, "you entirely fail to understand
me; and I can imagine that you, perhaps, fail to understand
your father also."</p>

<p>"If I do," said Lesley, proudly, "I hardly need to be
set right by a stranger."</p>

<p>The young doctor sprang to his feet. "I a stranger!"
he said. "I, who have known and appreciated and worked
with Caspar Brooke for the last half dozen years&mdash;I to be
called a stranger by his daughter? I don't think that's
fair: I don't indeed."</p>

<p>He paused and put his tea-cup down upon the table.
"If you'll only think for a minute, Miss Brooke," he said,
entreatingly, with such a sudden softening of voice and
manner that Lesley sat amazed, "I cannot believe but
that you'll pardon me. I owe so much to your father&mdash;he
has been a guide, a helper, almost a prophet to me, ever
since I came across him when I was a medical student at
King's College Hospital, and I only want everybody to
see him with my eyes&mdash;loving and reverent eyes, I can tell<a name="Page_99"></a>
you, though I wouldn't say so to everybody, seeing that
love and reverence seem to have gone out of fashion! But
to his daughter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His daughter surely does not need to be taught how
to think of him by another, whether he be an old friend
or a comparative stranger," said Lesley. "She can learn
to know him for herself."</p>

<p>"But <i>can</i> she?"&mdash;Maurice Kenyon's Irish strain, which
always led him to be more eager and explicit in speech
than if he had been entirely of Anglo-Saxon nationality,
was running away with him. "Are you sure that she can?
Look here, Miss Brooke: you come to your father's house
straight from a French convent, I believe. What <i>can</i> you
know of English life? of the strife of political parties, of
literary parties, of faiths and theories and passions? You
are plunged into the midst of a new world&mdash;it can't help but
be strange to you at first, and you must feel a trifle forlorn
and miserable&mdash;at least I should think so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lesley was in a dilemma. Kenyon's words were so true,
so apt, that they brought involuntary tears to her eyes.
She could get rid of the lump in her throat only by working
herself up into a rage: she could dissipate the tears only by
making her eyes flash with anger. The melting mood was
not to her taste. She chose the more hostile tone.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kenyon, excuse me, but you have no right at all
to talk about my being miserable. You may know my
father: you do not know me."</p>

<p>"But knowing your father so well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That has nothing to do with it. Am I not a separate
human being? What have you to do with me and my
feelings? You say that I do not know English ways&mdash;is
it an English way," cried Lesley, indignantly, "to try to
thrust yourself into a girl's confidence, and intrude where
you have not been asked to enter? Then English ways
are not those that I approve."</p>

<p>Maurice Kenyon felt that his cause was lost. He had
gone rather white about the lips as he listened to Lesley's
protest. Of course, he had offended her by his abominable
want of tact, he told himself&mdash;his intrusive proffer of unneeded
sympathy and help. But it was not in his nature
to acknowledge himself beaten, and to take his leave without
a word. His ardor impelled him to speak.</p>

<p>"Miss Brooke, I most sincerely beg your pardon," he
said, in tones of deep humility. "I see that I have made<a name="Page_100"></a>
a mistake&mdash;but I assure you that it was from the purest
motives. I don't"&mdash;forgetting his apologetic attitude for a
moment&mdash;"I <i>don't</i> think that you realize what a truly
great man your father is&mdash;how good, as well as great. I
<i>don't</i> think you understand him. But I beg your pardon
for seeming to think that I could enlighten you. Of
course, it must seem like impertinent interference to you.
But if you knew"&mdash;with a tremor of disappointment in his
voice&mdash;"what your father has been to me, you would not
perhaps be so surprised at my wanting his daughter to
sympathize with me in my feelings. I had no idea"&mdash;this
was intended to be a Parthian shot&mdash;"that my admiration
would be thought insulting."</p>

<p>He bowed very low, and turned to depart, vowing to
himself that nothing would induce him ever to enter that
drawing-room again; but Lesley, pale and wide-eyed,
called him back.</p>

<p>"Stay, Mr. Kenyon," she said, rising from her seat.</p>

<p>He halted, his hat in one hand, his fingers still on the
knob of the door.</p>

<p>"I never meant to say," said Lesley, confronting him,
"that I was incapable of sympathy with you in admiration
for my father. With my feeling towards him you have
nothing to do&mdash;that is all. I am not angry because you
express your own sentiments, but because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped and bit her lip.</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;Because I dared divine what yours might be?"
asked Maurice, boldly, and with an accent of reproach.
"Is it possible that yours <i>can</i> be like mine? and am I to
blame for saying so? How can you estimate the worth of
his work? You, a girl fresh from school! I know it is
very rude to say so, but I cannot help it. If you were
more of a woman, Miss Brooke, if you had had a wider
experience of life and mankind, you would acknowledge
that you could not possibly know very much of what your
father had done, and you would be glad of the opportunity
of learning!"</p>

<p>This was just the speech calculated to make Lesley
furiously angry, and it was with great difficulty that she
restrained the words that rose impetuously to her lips. She
stood motionless and silent, and Maurice mistook her
silence for that of stupid obstinacy, when it was the silence
of wounded feeling and passionate resentment. He went<a name="Page_101"></a>
on hotly, for he began to feel himself once more in the
right.</p>

<p>"Of course you <i>may</i> know all about him: you may
know as much as I who have lived and worked at his side,
so to speak, for the last six years! You may be familiar
with his writings: you may have seen the <i>Tribune</i> every
week, and you may know that wonderful book of his&mdash;'The
Unexplored' I mean, not the essays&mdash;by heart;
there may be nothing that I can tell you, even about his
gallant fight for one of the hospitals last year, or the splendid
work he has set going at the Macclesfield Buildings in
North London, or the way in which his name is blessed
by hundreds&mdash;yes hundreds&mdash;of men and women and
children whom he has helped to lead a better life! You
may know all about these things, and plenty more, but
you <i>can't</i> know&mdash;coming here without having seen him
since you were a baby&mdash;you <i>can't</i> know the beauty of his
character, or the depths of his sympathy for the erring, or
the tremendous efforts that he has made, and is still making,
for the laboring poor. You can't know this, or else
I'd tell you, Miss Brooke, what you would be doing! You
would be working heart and soul to lighten his burdens
and relieve him of the incessant drudgery that interferes
with his higher work, instead of sitting here day after day
reading yellow-backed novels in a drawing-room."</p>

<p>And then, in a white heat of indignation, Mr. Maurice
Kenyon took his leave. But he did not know the consternation
that he had created in Lesley's mind. She was
positively frightened by his vehemence. But she had never
seen an angry man before&mdash;never been spoken to in strong
masculine tones of reprobation and disgust, such as it
seemed to her that Maurice Kenyon had used. And for
what? She did not know. She was not aware that she
had behaved in an unfilial manner to her father. She did
not realize that her cold demeanor, her puzzled and bewildered
looks, had told Mr. Kenyon far more than she
would have cared to confess about the state of her feelings.
For the rest, Ethel's words and Maurice's vivid imagination
were to blame. And, angry as Lesley was, she felt
with a thrill of dismay that Mr. Kenyon's discourteous
words were perfectly true. She did not appreciate her
father; she did not know anything about him. All that
she had hitherto surmised was bad. And here came a<a name="Page_102"></a>
young man, apparently sane, certainly handsome and
clever, although disagreeable&mdash;to tell her that Caspar
Brooke was a hero, a man among ten thousand, an intellectual
giant, an uncrowned king. It was too ridiculous;
and Lesley laughed aloud&mdash;although as she laughed she
found that her eyes were wet with tears.<a name="Page_103"></a></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">"THE UNEXPLORED."</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Lesley</span> retained for some time a feeling of distinct anger
against Maurice Kenyon, even while she came to acknowledge
the truth of divers of his words. But their
truth, she told herself indignantly, was no justification of
his brutality. He was horribly rude and meddlesome and
intrusive. What business was it of his whether she gave
her father or not the meed of praise that he deserved?
Why should she be lectured for it by a stranger? Maurice
Kenyon's conduct&mdash;Maurice Kenyon himself&mdash;was intolerable,
and she should hate him all the days of her life.</p>

<p>And in good sooth, Maurice's behavior is somewhat
hard to excuse. He certainly had no business at all to
attack Lesley on the subject of her feelings about her
father, and his mode of attack was almost ludicrously
wanting in judgment and discrimination. But that which
tact and judgment might perhaps have failed to effect, Maurice's
sledge-hammer blows brought home to Lesley's understanding.
He was to blame; but he did some good, nevertheless.
When the first shock was over, Lesley began to
reflect that her own world had been a narrow one, and that
possibly there were others equally good. And this was a
great step to a girl who had been educated in a French
convent school.</p>

<p>Part of Lesley's inheritance from her father, and a part
of which she was quite unconscious, was a singularly fair
mind. She could judge and balance and discriminate with
an impartiality which was far beyond the power of the
ordinary woman. Being young her impartiality was now
and then disturbed by little gusts of passion and prejudice;
but the faculty was there to be strengthened by every
opportunity of exercising it. This faculty had been stirred
within her when Lady Alice first told her of her father's
existence; but she had tried to stifle it as an accursed
thing. She held it wicked to be anything but a partizan.<a name="Page_104"></a>
And now it had revived within her, and was urging her to
form no rash conclusions, to be careful in her thoughts
about her new acquaintances, to weigh her opinions before
expressing them. And all this in spite of a native fire and
vivacity of temperament which might have led her into
difficulties but for the counterbalancing power of judgment
which she had inherited from the father whom she had
been taught to despise.</p>

<p>So although she raged with all her young heart and
strength against Mr. Kenyon's construction of her feelings
and motives, she had the good sense to ask herself whether
there had not been some truth in what he said. After all,
what did she know of this strange father of hers, whose
every action she judged so harshly? She had heard her
mother's story, which certainly placed him in a very unamiable
light. But many years had gone by since Lady Alice
left her husband, and a man's character might be modified
in a dozen years or so. Lesley was willing to go so far.
He might even be repentant for the past. Then Sister
Rose's words came back to her. She, Lesley, might become
the instrument of reconciliation between two who
had been long divided!</p>

<p>The color flashed into her face and slowly faded away.
What chance had she of gaining her father's ear? True,
she could descant by the hour together, if she had the
opportunity, on Lady Alice's sweetness and goodness; but
when could she get the opportunity of speaking about
them to him? He looked on her with an eye of mistrust,
almost of contempt. She had been brought up in a school
of thought which he despised. How far away from her
now, by the by, seemed the old life with which she had
been familiar for so many years! the life of simple duties,
of easy routine, of praise and tenderness and placid contentment.
She was out in the world now, as other girls
were who had once shared with her the convent life near
Paris. Where were they now&mdash;Aglae and Marthe and
Lucile and Anastasie? Did they all find life in the world
as difficult as Lesley found it?</p>

<p>No, there was little chance, she decided, of acting as a
mediatrix between her parents. Her father would not
listen to any word she might say. And she was quite sure
that she could never speak of his private affairs to him.
They had been divided so many years; they were strangers
now, not father and daughter, as they ought to be.<a name="Page_105"></a></p>

<p>Curious to relate, a feeling of resentment against the
decree that had so long severed her from him rose up in
Lesley's heart. It was not exactly a feeling of resentment
against her mother. Rather it was a protest against fate&mdash;the
fate that had made that father a sealed book to her,
although known and read of all the world beside. If there
<i>were</i> admirable things in his nature, why had she been
kept in ignorance of them?&mdash;why told the one ugly fact of
his life which seemed to throw all the rest into shadow?
It was not fair, Lesley very characteristically remarked to
herself: it certainly was not fair.</p>

<p>If he was so distinguished a man in literature as Maurice
Kenyon represented him to be, why had she never been
allowed to read his books? She wanted, for the first time,
to read something that he had written. She supposed she
might; for there was no one now to choose her books for
her. Only a day or two before she had dutifully asked
her Aunt Sophia if she might read a book that Ethel had
lent her (it was the yellow-backed novel, the sight of which
had made Maurice so angry), and she had said, with her
horrid little laugh&mdash;oh, how Lesley hated Aunt Sophy's
laugh!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good heavens, child, read what you like! You're old
enough!"</p>

<p>And Lesley had felt crushed, but resolved to avail herself
of the permission. But where should she find her
father's works? She would cut out her tongue before she
asked Aunt Sophy for them, or her father, or the Kenyons,
or Mrs. Romaine.</p>

<p>She set to work to search the library shelves, and was
soon rewarded by the discovery of a set of <i>Tribunes</i>, a
weekly paper in which she knew that her father wrote.
She turned over the leaves, with a dazed feeling of bewilderment.
None of the articles were signed. And she had
no clue to those that were written by her father or anybody
else.</p>

<p>She returned the volumes to their places with a heavy
sigh, and continued to look through the shelves&mdash;especially
through the rows of ponderous quartos and octavos,
where she thought that her father's works would probably
be found. Simple Lesley! It was quite a shock to her
when at last&mdash;after she had relinquished her search in
heartsick disappointment&mdash;she suddenly came across a
little paper volume bearing this legend:<a name="Page_106"></a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Unexplored. By Caspar Brooke. Price One
Shilling. Tenth Edition."</p>

<p>She took the book in her hand and gazed at it curiously.
This was the "wonderful book" of which Maurice Kenyon
had spoken. This little shilling pamphlet&mdash;really it was
little more than a pamphlet! It seemed an extraordinary
thing to her that her father should write <i>shilling books</i>.
"A shilling shocker" was a name that Lesley happened to
know, and a thing that she heartily despised. Her taste
had been formed on the best models, and Lady Alice had
encouraged her in a critical disparagement of cheap literature.
Still&mdash;if Caspar Brooke had written it, and Maurice
Kenyon had recommended it, Lesley felt, with flushing
cheek and suspicious eyes, that it was a thing which she
ought to read.</p>

<p>Holding it gingerly, as if it were a dangerous combustible
which might explode at any moment, she hurried
away with it to her own room, turned the key in the lock,
and sat down to read.</p>

<p>At the risk of fatiguing my readers, I must say a word
or two about Caspar Brooke's romance "The Unexplored."
It had obtained a wonderful popularity in all English-speaking
countries, and was well known in every quarter
of the globe. Even Lady Alice must have seen it advertised
and reviewed and quoted a hundred times. Possibly
she had refused to read it, or closed her eyes to its merits.
Possibly what a man wrote seemed to her of little importance
compared to that which a man showed himself in his
daily life. At any rate, she had never mentioned the book
to her daughter Lesley. She certainly moved in a circle
which was slightly deaf to the echoes of literary fame.</p>

<p>"The Unexplored" was one of those powerful romances
of an ideal society with which recent days have made us
all familiar. But Caspar's book was the forerunner of the
shoal which the last ten years have cast upon our shores.
He was one of the first to follow in the steps of Sir Thomas
More and Sir Philip Sidney, and picture life as it should
be rather than as it is. His hero, an Englishman of our
own time, puzzled and distressed at the social misery and
discord surrounding him, leaves England and joins an
exploring expedition. In the unexplored recesses of the
new world he comes across a colony founded in ancient
days by a people who have preserved an idyllic purity of<a name="Page_107"></a>
heart and manners, together with a fuller artistic life and
truer civilization than our own. To these people he
brings his stories of London as it is to-day, and fills their
gentle hearts with amazement and dismay. A slender
thread of love-making gives the book its romantic charm.
He gains the affections of the king's daughter, a beautiful
maiden, who has been attracted to him from the very first;
and with her he hopes to realize all that has been unknown
to him of noble life in his own country. But the book
does not end with its hero and heroine lapped in slothful
content. For the heart of the maiden burns with sorrow
for the toiling poor of the great European cities of which
he has told her: to her this region has also the charm of
"The Unexplored," and the book ends with a hint that
she and her husband are about to wend their way, with a
new gospel in their hand, to the very city of which he had
shaken the dust from his shoes in disgust before he found
an unexplored Arcadia.</p>

<p>There was not much novelty in the plot&mdash;the charm of
the book lay in the way the story was told, in the beauty
of the language; and also&mdash;last but not least&mdash;the burning
earnestness of the author's tone as he contrasted the hopeless,
heartless misery of the poor in our great cities with
the ideal life of man. His pictures of London life, drawn
from the street, the hospital, the workhouse, were touched
in with merciless fidelity: his satire on the modern benevolence
and modern civilization which allows such evils to
flourish side by side with lecture-rooms, churches, intellectual
culture, and refined luxury was keen and scathing.
It was a book which had startled people, but had also
brought many new truths to their minds. And although
no one could be more startled, yet no one could be more
avid for the truth than the author's own daughter, of whom
he had never thought in the very least when he wrote the
book.</p>

<p>Lesley rose from her perusal of it with burning cheeks
and humid eyes. She herself, without knowing it, was in
much the same position as the heroine of her father's book.
Like the girl Ione, in "The Unexplored," she had lived in
a charmed seclusion, far from the roar of modern civilization,
far from the great cities which are the abomination of
desolation in our time. Knowledge had come to her
filtered through the minds of those who closed their eyes<a name="Page_108"></a>
to evil and their ears to tales of sin. She did not know
how the poor lived: she had only the vaguest and haziest
possible notions concerning misery and want and disease.
She was not only pure and innocent, but she was ignorant.
She had scarcely ever seen a newspaper. She had read
very few novels. She had lived almost all her life with
women, and she had imbibed the notion that her marriage
was a matter which her mother would arrange without
particularly consulting her (Lesley's) inclinations.</p>

<p>To a girl brought up in this way there was much to
shock and repel in Caspar Brooke's romance. More than
once, indeed, she put it down indignantly: more than once
she cried out, in the silence of her room, "Oh, but it can't
be true!" Nevertheless, she knew in her heart of hearts
that the strong and burning words which she was reading
could not have been written were they not sincerely felt.
And as for facts, she could easily put them to the test.
She could ask other people to tell her whether they were
true. Were there really so many criminals in London; so
many people "without visible means of subsistence?" so
many children going out in a morning to their Board
Schools without breakfast? But surely something ought
to be done! How could people sit down and allow these
things to be? How could her father himself, who wrote
about such things, live in comfort, even (compared with
the wretchedly poor) in modest luxury, without lifting a
finger to help them?</p>

<p>But there Lesley caught herself up. What had Mr.
Kenyon said? Had he not spoken of the things that
Caspar Brooke had done? For almost the first time Lesley
began to wonder what made her father so busy. She
had never heard a word concerning the pursuits that Mr.
Kenyon had mentioned as so engrossing. "The splendid
work at Macclesfield Buildings:" what was that? The
people whom he had helped: what people? Whom could
she ask? Not her father himself&mdash;that was out of the
question. He never spoke to her except on trivial subjects.
She remembered with a sudden and painful flash of
insight, that conversations between him and his sister were
sometimes broken off when she came into the room, or
carried on in half-phrases and under-tones. Of course she
<i>had</i> heard of Macclesfield Buildings; and of a club and
an institute and a hospital, and what not; but the words<a name="Page_109"></a>
had gone over her head, being destitute of meaning and of
interest for her. She had been blind and deaf, it seemed
to her now, ever since she came into the house; but Maurice
Kenyon and her father's book had opened her eyes
to the reality of things.</p>

<p>Later on in the day her maid came to help her to dress
for dinner. Lesley looked at her with new interest. For
was she not one of the great, poor, struggling mass of
human beings whom her father called "the People?" Not
the happy peasant-class, as depicted in sentimental storybooks:
whether that existed or not, Lesley was not learned
enough to say: it certainly did not exist in London. She
looked at the woman who waited on her with keenly
observant eyes. Her name was Mary Kingston, and Lesley
knew that she was not one of the prosperous, self-satisfied,
over-dressed type, so common amongst ladies'
maids; for she had been "out of a situation" for some
time, and had fallen into dire straits of poverty. It would
not have been like Miss Brooke to hire a common-place,
conventional ladies' maid; she really preferred a servant
"with a history." Lesley remembered that she had heard
of Mary Kingston's past difficulties without noting them.</p>

<p>"Kingston," she said, gently, "do you know much
about the poor?"</p>

<p>Kingston started and colored. She was a woman of
more than thirty years of age&mdash;pale, thin, flat-chested, not
very tall; she had fairly good features and dark, expressive
eyes; but she was not attractive-looking. Her lips were
too pale and her dark eyes too sunken for beauty. There
was a gentleness in her manner, however, a patience in her
low voice, which Lesley had always liked. It reminded
her, in some undefined way, of her old friend, Sister Rose.</p>

<p>"I've lived among the poor all my life, ma'am," Kingston
said.</p>

<p>"Do they suffer very much?" Lesley asked.</p>

<p>Kingston looked slightly puzzled. "Suffer, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;from hunger and cold, I mean: I have been
reading about poor people in this book&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kingston cast a rapid glance at the volume. Her face
kindled at once.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "I've read that book, ma'am, and what
a beautiful book it is!"<a name="Page_110"></a></p>

<p>"Do you know it?" Lesley asked, amazed. Then,
moved by a sudden impulse, "And you know it was
written by my father?"</p>

<p>Who would have thought that she could say the last
two words with such an accent of tender pride?</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, I did not know. Is it really <i>this</i> Mr.
Brooke? The name, you see, is not so uncommon as
some, and I did not think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, I know," said Lesley, hurriedly. "But just
tell me this&mdash;is it true? Do the poor people suffer as
much in England as he says they do?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, ma'am, I'm afraid so, at least. I've seen a
good deal of suffering in my day."</p>

<p>Lesley was quiet for a little while, and the woman
brushed out her shining hair. "Tell me," she said, "what
is the worst suffering of all&mdash;will you? I mean, a suffering
caused by being poor&mdash;nothing to do with your own life,
of course. Is it the being hungry, or cold&mdash;or what?"</p>

<p>Kingston considered for a moment. "I think," she
said at last, "it isn't the being cold or hungry yourself that
matters so much as seeing those that belong to you cold
and hungry. That's the worst. If you have children, it
does go to your heart to hear them ask you for something
to eat, and you have nothing to give them."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lesley, softly, "I should think that is the
worst."</p>

<p>"But I don't know," said Kingston, in a perfectly unmoved
and stolid tone, "whether it's worse than having no
candles."</p>

<p>Lesley looked up in astonishment.</p>

<p>"It's when any one's ill that you feel that," the woman
went on, in the same level tones. "In winter it's dark,
maybe, at four o'clock, and not light again till nearly nine
in the morning. It doesn't matter so much if you can go
out. But if you have to sit by some one who's ill, and
you can't see their faces, and if they leave off moaning you
think they're dead&mdash;and perhaps when the early morning
light comes it's only a dead face you have to look upon,
and you never saw them draw their last breath&mdash;why, then,
you feel mad-like to think of the candles that are wasted in
big houses and of the bread that's thrown away."</p>

<p>Lesley listened, appalled. A homely detail of this kind
impressed her more than any appeal to her higher imagin<a name="Page_111"></a>ation.
The woes of the poor had suddenly become real.</p>

<p>"I hope you never had to go through all that, Kingston,"
she said, very gently.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, twice," said Kingston. "Once with my
mother, and once with my little boy. They were both
dead in the morning, but I didn't see 'em die."</p>

<p>"But where was your husband? Was he dead?" said
Lesley, quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, ma'am. But he was amusing himself. He
was a gentleman, you see&mdash;more shame to me, perhaps
you'll say. I couldn't expect him to think of things like
candles."</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;And is he&mdash;is he dead?"</p>

<p>"No ma'am, he isn't dead," said Kingston. And from
the shortness of her tone and the steadiness with which
she averted her face Lesley came to the conclusion that
she did not want to be questioned any more.</p>

<p>Lesley went down to dinner feeling that she had made
some new and extraordinary discoveries. She noticed
that her father and her aunt made several allusions which
would have seemed mysterious and repellant to her the
day before, but which now possessed an almost tragic interest.
When before had she heard her aunt speak casually
of a Mothers' Meeting and a Lending Library? These
were common-place matters to the ordinary English girl;
but to Lesley they possessed the elements of a romance.
For was it not by means of hackneyed, common-place
machinery of this kind that cultured men and women put
themselves into relation with the great, suffering, coarse,
uncultured, human-hearted poor?<a name="Page_112"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">LESLEY SEEKS ADVICE.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Added</span> to Lesley's new views of life, there was also a new
feeling for her father. In the first rush of enthusiastic admiration
for his book, she forgot all that she had heard
against him, and believed&mdash;for the moment&mdash;that he was
all Maurice Kenyon represented him to be. But naturally
this state of mind could not last. The long years of her
mother's influence told against any claim to love or respect
on the father's part. Lesley remembered how bitterly
Lady Alice spoke of him. She could not think that her
mother had been wrong.</p>

<p>It is a terrible position for a son or daughter&mdash;to have to
judge between father and mother. It is a wrong position,
and one in which Lesley felt instinctively that she ought
never to have been placed. Of course it was impossible
for her to help it. Father and mother had virtually made
her their judge. They said to her, "Live for a year with
each of us, and choose which you prefer. You cannot
have us both." And as the only true and natural position for
a child is that in which he or she can have both, Lesley
Brooke was in a very trying situation. She had begun life
in her father's house as her mother's ardent partisan; and
she was her mother's partisan still. Only she was not
quite sure whether she was not going to find that she
could love her father too. And in that case, Lesley was
tremulously certain that Lady Alice would accuse her of
unfaithfulness to <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>She turned with a sigh from the contemplation of her
position to her new views of London and modern life. The
poverty and ignorance of which she read had seemed hateful
to her. But her impulse&mdash;always the impulse of generous
souls&mdash;was not to shrink away from this newly-discovered
misery, but to go down into the midst of it and
help to cure the evil.<a name="Page_113"></a></p>

<p>Still blindly ignorant of what was already done, or doing,
she hardly knew in which way to begin a work that was so
new to her. Indeed, she hardly estimated its difficulties.
All the poor that she had ever seen were the blue-bloused
peasants, or brown-faced crones, and quaint little maidens
with pigtails, who had visited the convent at Fontainebleau.
She was quite sure that English poor people were not like
these. Her father knew a great deal about them, but she
could not ask him. The very way in which he spoke to
her&mdash;lightly always, and jestingly&mdash;made serious questioning
impossible. To whom then should she apply? The
answer presented itself almost immediately, and with extraordinary
readiness&mdash;to Mr. Oliver Trent.</p>

<p>This decision was not so remarkable as it at first may
seem. Lesley had run over in her mind a list of the persons
whom she could not or would not ask. Her father
and Miss Brooke?&mdash;impossible. Mrs. Romaine?&mdash;certainly
not. Ethel?&mdash;Lesley did not believe that she knew
anything about the poor. Maurice Kenyon?&mdash;not for
worlds. The neighboring clergy?&mdash;Mr. Brooke had said
that he did not want "the Blacks" about his house. The
other men and women whom Lesley had seen were mere
casual acquaintances; not friends of the family, like Oliver
Trent.</p>

<p>At least, she <i>supposed</i> that Oliver was a friend of the
family. He was Mrs. Romaine's brother; and Mrs. Romaine
was a good deal at the house. In her own mind
Lesley put him on the same footing as Mr. Kenyon&mdash;which
estimate would have made Caspar Brooke exceedingly
indignant, could he have known it. For though he did not
exactly dislike Oliver Trent, he would never have thought
of classing him with his friend, Maurice Kenyon.</p>

<p>But Oliver had already called twice on some pretext or
other, since Lesley had come home: and on the latter of
these occasions he had sat for a full hour with her in the
drawing-room, talking chiefly of France and Italy&mdash;in low
and softly modulated tones. Lesley was losing all her
horror of interviews with young men. If the nuns had seen
her now they would indeed have thought her lost to all
sense of propriety. For one of Miss Brooke's chief theories
was that no self-respecting young woman needs a
chaperon. And she had flatly refused to chaperone Lesley
except on inevitable or really desirable occasions. "The<a name="Page_114"></a>
girl must learn to go about the world by herself," she had
said. "And I will say this for Lesley, she is not naturally
timid or helpless&mdash;it is only training that makes her so."
And under this tuition Lesley soon acquired the self-possession
in which she had been somewhat wanting when she
came, newly-fledged, from her convent.</p>

<p>So when Oliver called again&mdash;it was on a message from
his sister, and it had not yet recurred to Lesley to wonder
at the readiness shown by English brothers to run on
messages to their sisters' friends&mdash;he found Lesley alone,
as usual, in the drawing-room, and she welcomed him with
considerable warmth&mdash;a warmth that took him by surprise.</p>

<p>"I am so glad to see you, Mr. Trent: I wanted to ask
you something," she said, at once.</p>

<p>"Ask me anything&mdash;command me in anything," he replied.</p>

<p>He sank into a low chair at her right hand, and looked
quite devotionally into her face. Lesley felt a trifle disturbed.
She could not forget that Oliver was Ethel's lover,
and she did not think that he ought to look at her so&mdash;<i>eagerly</i>&mdash;she
did not know what else to call it. It was a
look that made her uncomfortable. Nobody had ever
looked at her in that way before. They did not look like
that in the convent.</p>

<p>"It is nothing very particular," she said, shrinking back
a little. "Only I have nobody to ask."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I understand," said Oliver, in his softest tones.
Somehow his sympathy did not offend her, as Mr. Kenyon's
had done.</p>

<p>"It is very stupid of me," Lesley went on, trying to
smile, "not to ask my father or Aunt Sophy; but I am
afraid they would only laugh at me."</p>

<p>"I shall not laugh at you," said Oliver, marvelling
inwardly.</p>

<p>"Won't you? You are sure? It is only a little, stupid,
ordinary question. Do you know anything about Macclesfield
Buildings?"</p>

<p>Oliver drew himself up in his chair. Was <i>that</i> the question?
He did not believe it. But he answered her unsmilingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Brooke. They are the blocks of workmen's
dwellings where your father has founded a <a name="tn_119"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "Club."-->Club."</p>

<p>"Has he?" said Lesley, her eyes dilating. "That is&mdash;very
good of him, isn't it?"<a name="Page_115"></a></p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose so," Oliver answered, with a little laugh.
"Of course&mdash;but I must not insinuate worldly motives into
his daughter's ears!"</p>

<p>"Oh, please, go on: I want to hear!"</p>

<p>"It is nothing wrong. Only if a man wants to stand
well with the working-people&mdash;if he wants votes, for instance&mdash;it
isn't at all a bad move to begin with a Working-Men's
Club."</p>

<p>"Votes, Mr. Trent? What for?"</p>

<p>"School Board, or County Council, or Parliament," said
Oliver, coolly. "Or even Board of Guardians. I don't
know what your father's ambitions are, exactly. But
popularity is always a good thing."</p>

<p>Lesley pondered a little, the color rising in her cheeks.
"Then," she said, "you think my father does good things
from&mdash;from what people call 'interested motives?'"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, no, Miss Brooke, I never said anything
of the kind," declared Oliver, somewhat alarmed by her
straightforwardness. "I was only thinking of the general
actions of man, not of your father in particular."</p>

<p>Lesley nodded. "I don't quite understand," she said.
"But that doesn't matter for the present. I have another
question to ask you, Mr. Trent. Do you know anything
about the poor?"</p>

<p>"I'm very poor myself," said Oliver, laughing. "Horribly
poor. 'Pon my word, I don't know any one poorer."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are laughing at me now," said Lesley, almost
petulantly. "And you said that you would not laugh."</p>

<p>She leaned back in her chair, with heightened color and
brightening eyes: her breath came a little more quickly
than usual, as if her pulses were quickened. There is
nothing so catching as emotion. Oliver's sluggish pulses
began to stir at the sight of her. That soft and tender
face seemed more beautiful to him than the sparkle and
vivacity of Ethel Kenyon's. If it had not been for Ethel's
twenty thousand pounds, he did not know but what he
would have preferred Lesley. Rosy had said that Lesley
would suit him best.</p>

<p>"I am not laughing; I swear I am not," he said earnestly.
"I know what you mean&mdash;you are thinking of the
London poor. Your tender heart has been stirred by the
sight of them in the streets&mdash;they are dreadful to look at,
are they not? It is like you to feel their woes so acutely."<a name="Page_116"></a></p>

<p>"I want to know," said Lesley, rather plaintively,
"whether I cannot do anything for them?"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;do anything&mdash;for the poor?" repeated Oliver.
Then he scanned her narrowly&mdash;scanned her shining hair,
delicate features, Paris-made gown, and dainty shoe&mdash;and
laughed a little. "You can let them look at you&mdash;that
ought to be enough," he said.</p>

<p>Lesley frowned. "Nonsense, Mr. Trent. What does
my father do for his Club?"</p>

<p>"Smokes with the men, sometimes, I believe. You
couldn't do that, you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Although&mdash;&mdash;" and then Lesley stopped short and
laughed.</p>

<p>"Although Aunt Sophy does. It's no secret, my dear
Miss Brooke. Half the women in London smoke now-a-days,
I believe. Even my sister indulges now and then."</p>

<p>Lesley gave her head a little toss. "What else does my
father do?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Sings to them. Sunday afternoon, that is, you know.
The wives are allowed to come to the Club-room then, and
he has a sort of little concert for them&mdash;good music, sacred
music, even, I believe. He gets professionals to come now
and then; they will do anything to oblige your father, you
know&mdash;and when they don't come, he sings himself. He
really has a very good bass voice."</p>

<p>"Ladies don't sing, I suppose," said Lesley, after a little
pause.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they do. He nearly always has a lady to
sing. Why don't you go down on a Sunday afternoon?
The club is open to friends of the founder, if not of the
members, on Sunday afternoons. Don't Mr. Brooke and
Miss Brooke always go?"</p>

<p>"I suppose they do&mdash;I never asked where they went,"
said Lesley, with burning cheeks. She remembered that
they always did disappear on Sunday afternoons. No, she
had not asked; she had not hitherto felt any curiosity as
to their doings; and they had not asked her to accompany
them. She began to resent their lack of readiness to invite
her to the club.</p>

<p>"You might go down on Sunday afternoon," said Oliver,
lazily. "I'm going: they have asked me to sing. Though
you mayn't know it, Miss Brooke, I have a very decent
tenor voice. Ethel is going with me. Won't you come?"<a name="Page_117"></a></p>

<p>"I don't know," said Lesley, nervously. She bethought
herself that she could not easily propose to accompany her
father, and that Ethel and Oliver Trent would not want
her. She would be one too many in either party. She
could not go.</p>

<p>But Oliver read the reason of her scruples. "If you
will allow me," he said, "I will ask my sister to come too.
Then we shall be a compact little party of four, and we
can start off without telling Mr. Brooke anything about
it."</p>

<p>Lesley hesitated a little, but finally consented. She had
a great desire to see what was going on in Macclesfield
Buildings. But Oliver, it may be feared, believed in his
heart that she went because he was going. And he resolved
to bestow his society on her rather than on Ethel and Mrs.
Romaine on Sunday. It was decidedly more amusing to
waken that still sweet face to animation than to engage in
a war of wit with Ethel.</p>

<p>Lesley thought of Oliver very little. Once or twice he
had startled her by an assumption of intimacy, a softening
of his voice, and a look of tenderness in his eyes, which
made her shrink into herself with an instinctive emotion of
dislike. But she had then proceeded to scold herself for
foolish shyness and prudery&mdash;the prudery of a French-school
girl, who was not accustomed to the ways of men.
She had begun to feel herself very ignorant of the world
since she came to her father's house. It would never do
to offend one of her father's friends by seeming afraid of
him. So she tried to smile and looked pleased when Oliver
drew near, and she was all the more gracious to him because
she had already quarrelled with Maurice Kenyon,
who was even more her father's friend than Oliver himself.
But what could she do? Mr. Kenyon had insulted her&mdash;the
hot blood rose to her cheeks as she thought of some of
the things that he had said. Insulted her by assuming that
she could not appreciate her father because she was too
careless, too frivolous, too foolish to do so. That she was
ignorant, Lesley was ready to acknowledge; but not that
she was incapable of learning.</p>

<p>Oliver had no difficulty in persuading his sister to make
one of the party on Sunday afternoon. Indeed, Mrs. Romaine
made the expedition easier by inviting Lesley to
lunch with her beforehand.<a name="Page_118"></a></p>

<p>"I asked Maurice and Ethel Kenyon, too," she said to
Lesley, "but they would not come. Mr. Kenyon had his
patients to attend to; and Ethel would not leave him to
lunch alone."</p>

<p>Lesley did not answer, but privately reflected that if the
Kenyons had accepted the invitation she would have
lunched at home.</p>

<p>She went to church by herself on Sunday morning, for
Mr. Brooke was not up, and Doctor Sophy frequented some
assembly of eclectic souls, of which Lesley had never heard
before. So she went demurely to that ugliest of all Protestant
temples, St. Pancras' Church, and was not very
much surprised when she perceived that Oliver Trent was
in the seat behind her, and that he sat so that he could see
her face.</p>

<p>"I did not know that you went to St. Pancras'," she
said, innocently, as they stood on the steps together outside
when the service was over.</p>

<p>"Nor do I," he answered her. "It is the most hideous
church I ever saw. But there was an attraction this
morning."</p>

<p>Lesley looked as if she did not understand. And indeed
she did not.</p>

<p>"You are coming to lunch with us, are you not? Will
you let me escort you?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Trent. But&mdash;do you mind?&mdash;I shall
have to call at my father's house on my way. Just to
leave my prayer-book. It will not take me a minute."</p>

<p>Oliver could not object, although he was not altogether
pleased. For Mr. Brooke's house was immediately opposite
the Kenyons', and Miss Ethel was as likely as not to be
sitting at the drawing-room window. Her sharp eyes
would espy him from afar, and she might ask Lesley if he
had been to church with her. Not a very great difficulty,
but Oliver had a far-seeing mind, and one question might
lead to others of a more serious kind.</p>

<p>However, there was no help for it. He paused on the
steps of number fifty, while Lesley rang the bell. She had
been formally presented with a latch-key, but the use of it
was so new to her, and the fear of losing it so great, that
she usually left it on her dressing-table.</p>

<p>A maid opened the door and said something to Lesley
in an under tone. Oliver was looking across the street<a name="Page_119"></a>
and neither heard the words nor saw the woman's face.
But Lesley turned to him hastily.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Trent, I am so sorry to keep you waiting,
but I must run up to my aunt for a moment."</p>

<p>She disappeared into the house, and then Oliver turned
and met the eyes of Lesley's waiting-maid. And at the
same moment he was aware&mdash;as one is sometimes aware
of what goes on behind one's back&mdash;that Ethel, in her
pretty autumn dress of fawn-color and deep brown, had
come out upon the balcony of her house and was observing
him.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i>, Mary?" said Oliver, in a stifled whisper.</p>

<p>The woman looked at him with hard, defiant eyes. "Yes,
me," she said. "You ought to know that I couldn't do
anything else."</p>

<p>He stood looking at her with a frown.</p>

<p>"This is the last place where you ought to have come,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Because they are friends of yours?" she asked. "I
can't help that. I didn't know it when I came, but I know
it now."</p>

<p>"Then leave," said Oliver, still in the lowest possible
tone, but also with all possible intensity. "Leave as soon
as you can. I'll find you another place. It is the worst
thing you can do for your own interest to remain here, where
you may be recognized."</p>

<p>"I can take care of that," said Mary Kingston, icily.
"I'll think over it."</p>

<p>Oliver put his hand into his pocket as if in search of a
coin. But Kingston suddenly shook her head. "No,"
she said, quickly, "I don't want it. Not from you."</p>

<p>And then Lesley's foot was heard upon the stairs.
Oliver looked up to Ethel's balcony. Yes, she was there,
her hand upon the railing, her eyes fixed on him with what
was evidently a puzzled stare. Oliver smiled and raised
his hat. Ethel nodded and smiled in return. But he fancied&mdash;though,
of course, at that distance he could not be
sure&mdash;that she still looked puzzled as she returned his bow
and smile.</p>

<p>He walked on with Lesley. But his good-humor was
gone: the usual suavity of his manner was a little ruffled.
His recognition of Mary Kingston had evidently been displeasing
as well as embarrassing to him.<a name="Page_120"></a></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">"HOME, SWEET HOME."</p>

<p><span class="firstwords">Mrs. Romaine</span> and Oliver Trent attributed Lesley's desire
to see Macclesfield Buildings to a young girl's curiosity,
and, perhaps, to a desire for Oliver's company. They had
no conception of the new fancies and feelings, aims and
interests, which were developing in her soul. Only so
much of these were visible as to lead Oliver to say to his
sister before they sallied forth that afternoon&mdash;</p>

<p>"I fancy she is getting up an enthusiasm for her father.
Won't that be awkward for you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine was silent for a moment. Then she answered,
with perfect quietness&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think it will be more awkward for Lady Alice. It
may be rather convenient for us."</p>

<p>And Oliver noticed that for the rest of the afternoon she
took every opportunity of indirectly and directly praising
Mr. Brooke, his works and ways. But he could not see
that Lesley looked pleased&mdash;perhaps Mrs. Romaine's words
had rather an artificial ring.</p>

<p>Somehow, it seemed to Lesley as if she hated the expedition
on which she came. Was it not a little too like
spying upon her father's work? He had never invited her
to Macclesfield Buildings. And he would never know the
spirit in which she came: it would seem to him as
though she had been brought in Mrs. Romaine's train,
perhaps against her will, to laugh, to stare, to criticize.
She would rather have crept in humbly, and tried to understand,
by herself, what he was trying to do. What would
he think of her when he saw her there that afternoon?</p>

<p>She was morbidly afraid of him and of his opinion.
Caspar Brooke would have been as much hurt as astonished
if he knew in what ogre-like light she regarded him.</p>

<p>Ethel joined them before they started for Macclesfield
Buildings, and as rain was beginning to fall, Oliver insisted<a name="Page_121"></a>
that they should take a cab. It was for his own sake, as
Rosalind reminded him, rather than for theirs. He had a
profound dislike of dirty streets, dirty people, unpleasant
sights and sounds. And there were plenty of these to be
encountered in the North London district to which they
were bound that afternoon.</p>

<p>The three Londoners&mdash;for such they virtually were&mdash;could
hardly refrain from laughing when they saw Lesley's
horrified face as the cab drove up to the block of buildings
in which the club was situated. "But this is a prison&mdash;a
workhouse&mdash;a lunatic asylum!" she exclaimed. "People
do not live here&mdash;do they&mdash;in this dreary place?"</p>

<p>Ah, me, and a dreary place it was! Three lofty blocks
of building, all of the same drab hue, with iron-railed balconies
outside the narrow windows, and a great court-yard
in which a number of children romped and howled and
shrieked in play: it was perhaps the most depressingly
ugly bit of architecture that Lesley had ever seen. In vain
her friends told her of the superior sanitary arrangements,
the ventilation, the drainage, the pure water "laid on;"
all she could do was to clasp her hand, and say, with
positive tears in her bright eyes, "But <i>why</i> could it not
all have been made more beautiful?" And indeed it is
hard to say why not.</p>

<p>"Now we are going down into a coal hole," said Oliver,
as he helped the ladies to alight. "At least it was once a
coal hole. Yes, it was. These four rooms were used as
storehouses for coals and vegetables until your father rented
them: you will see what they look like now."</p>

<p>"Lesley is horrified," said Ethel, with a little laugh.
"Not at the coal-hole," Lesley answered, trying also to
be merry, "but at the ugliness of it all. Don't you think
this kind of ugliness almost wicked?"</p>

<p>"Oliver thinks all ugliness wicked," said Mrs. Romaine,
maliciously.</p>

<p>"Then <i>we</i> ought to be very good," said Ethel. But
Oliver did not answer: he was looking at Lesley, whose
face had grown pale.</p>

<p>"Are you tired?&mdash;are you ill?" he asked her, in the
gentlest undertones. They were still picking their way
over the muddy stones of the court-yards, and rough
children ran up to them now and then, and clamored for a
penny. "Is the sight of this place too much for you?"<a name="Page_122"></a></p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Lesley, with a sudden, inexplicable flush
of color: "It is not that&mdash;it is ugly, of course; but I do
not mind it at all."</p>

<p>Oliver glanced round suspiciously, as if to discover why
she had blushed. All that he could see was the tall figure
of Maurice Kenyon, who was standing in a doorway talking
to somebody on the stairs. Even if Lesley had seen
him, she surely would not blush for that! What chance
had Kenyon had of becoming acquainted with her? Oliver
forgot that other sisters besides his own might send their
brothers on messages.</p>

<p>Down a flight of stone steps, through a low doorway,
and into a dark little corridor, was Lesley conducted. She
noticed that Mrs. Romaine and Ethel were quite accustomed
to the place. "We have often been before, you know,"
Ethel explained. "It's your father's hobby, you know;
his doll's house, or Noah's Ark, or whatever you like to
call it&mdash;his pet toy. I always call it his Noah's Ark myself.
The animals walk in two by two. The men may
bring their wives on Sundays. Oh, by the bye, Lesley, I
hope you don't mind smoke. The men have their pipes,
you know."</p>

<p>And then Lesley, dazzled and confounded by her surroundings,
found herself in a brilliantly lighted room of
considerable size&mdash;really two ordinary rooms thrown into
one. Immediately the squalor and ugliness of the outer
world were thrown into the background. The walls of the
room were distempered&mdash;Indian red below, warm grey
above; and on the grey walls were hung fine photographs
of well-known foreign buildings or of celebrated paintings.
In one part of the room stood a magnificent billiard-table,
now neatly covered with a cloth. A neat little piano was
placed at the other end of the room, near a large table
covered with a scarlet cloth, strewn with magazines, papers,
and books, and decorated with flowers. The chairs were
of solid make, seated with red leather ornamented with
brass nails. In fact, the whole place was not only comfortable,
but cheery and pleasant to the eye. Lesley was
told that there was also a library, beside a kitchen and
pantry, whence visitors could get tea or coffee, "temperance
drinks," and rolls or cakes.</p>

<p>A few women in their "Sunday best" were looking at
the books and periodicals, or gossiping together, but they<a name="Page_123"></a>
were not so numerous as the men&mdash;respectable working-men
for the most part; some of them smoking, some reading
or talking, without their pipes. In one little group
Lesley recognized, with a start, that her father was the
centre of attraction. He was sitting, as the other men
were, and he was talking: the musical notes of his cultivated
voice rose clearly above the hum of rougher and
huskier voices. Lesley gathered that some proposition
had been made which he was combating.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I won't have it. Look here&mdash;did you
open this club, or did I?"</p>

<p>"You did, guv'nor," said one of the men.</p>

<p>"Then I'll have my say in the management. Some of
you want the women turned out, do you? It's the curse
of modern life, the curse of English and all other society,
that you do want the women turned out, you men, where-ever
you go. And the reason is that women are better
than you are. They are purer, nobler, more conscientious
than you, and therefore you don't want them with you
when you take your pleasures. Eh?"</p>

<p>There was a melodious geniality about the last monosyllable
which made the men smile in spite of themselves.</p>

<p><a name="tn_128"></a><!--TN: Single quote added before the final "t" of "'T'aint"-->"'T'ain't that," said one of them, awkwardly. "It's
because they're apt to neglect their 'omes if they come out
of an afternoon or an evening like we do."</p>

<p>"Not they!" said Mr. Brooke. "To come out now
and then is to make them love their homes, man. They'll
put more heart in to their work, if they have a little rest and
enjoyment now and then, as you do. Besides&mdash;you've got
hold of a wrong principle. The women are not your slaves
and servants; they ought not to be. They are your companions,
your helpers. The more they are in sympathy
with you, the better they will help you. Don't keep your
wives out of the brighter moments of your lives, else they
will forget how to feel with you, and help you when darker
moments come!"</p>

<p>There was a pause; and then a man, with rather a sullen
face&mdash;evidently one of the malcontents&mdash;said, with a growl,</p>

<p>"Fine talk, gov'nor. It'll end in our wives leaving us,
like they say yours done."</p>

<p>There was an instant hiss and groan of disapproval. So
marked, indeed, that the man rose to shoulder his way to
the door. Evidently he was not a popular character.<a name="Page_124"></a></p>

<p>"We'll pay him out, if you like, sir," said a youth; and
some of the older men half rose as if to execute the threat.</p>

<p>"Sit down: let him alone," said Mr. Brooke, sharply.
"He's a poor fool, and he knows it. Every man's a fool
that does not reverence women. And if women would try
to be worthy of that reverence, the world would be better
than it is."</p>

<p>He rose as he spoke, with apparent carelessness, but
those who knew him best saw that the taunt had stung
him. And as he moved, he caught Lesley's eye. He had
not known that she was to be there; and by something in
her expression&mdash;by her heightened color, perhaps, or her
startled eye&mdash;he saw at once that she had heard the man's
rude speech and his reply.</p>

<p>He stopped short, grasped at his beard as his manner
was, especially when he was perplexed or embarrassed;
then crossed over towards her, laid his hand on her arm,
and spoke in a tone of unusual tenderness.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> here, my child?"</p>

<p>Lesley thrilled all over with the novel pleasure of what
seemed to her like commendation. But she could not
answer suitably.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Romaine brought me," she said.</p>

<p>"Ah! Mrs. Romaine?"&mdash;in quite a different tone. "Very
kind of Mrs. <a name="tn_129"></a><!-- TN: Comma changed to period after "Romaine"-->Romaine. By the bye, Maurice"&mdash;to Mr.
Kenyon, who had just appeared upon the scene, and was
looking with curiously anxious eyes at Lesley&mdash;"the music
ought to begin now. Is Trent ready? And will Ethel
recite something? That's all right&mdash;I suppose Miss Bellot
will be here presently."</p>

<p>And leaving Lesley without another glance, he went to
the piano and opened it. The audience settled itself in its
place, and gave a little sigh of expectation. Mr. Brooke's
Sunday afternoon "recitals," from four to five, always
gave great satisfaction.</p>

<p>Oliver sang first, then Ethel recited something; then
Mr. Brooke sang, and then Oliver played&mdash;he was a very
useful young man in his way&mdash;and then there came a little
pause.</p>

<p>"A certain Miss Bellot promised to come and sing, but
she has not appeared," Ethel explained to her friend.
"Lesley, you can sing: I know you can, for I saw a lot of
songs in your portfolio the other day. Won't you give
them something?"<a name="Page_125"></a></p>

<p>"Oh, no, I couldn't!"</p>

<p>"It's not a critical audience," said Oliver, on her other
side. "You might try. The people are growing impatient,
and your father will be disappointed if things do not go
well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lesley flushed deeply. A week ago she would have
thought&mdash;What is it to me if my father is disappointed?
But she could not think so to-night.</p>

<p>"I have no music here. And I cannot sing properly
when I play my own accompaniments."</p>

<p>"Tell me something you know and let me see whether I
can play it," said Oliver.</p>

<p>She paused for a moment, then, with a smile in her eyes,
she mentioned a name which made him laugh and elevate
his eyebrows. "Do you know <i>that</i>?" she said.</p>

<p>"Rather! Is it not a trifle hackneyed? Ah, well, not
for this audience, perhaps. Yes, I will play." And then,
just as Caspar Brooke, with a slight gesture of annoyance,
turned to explain to the people that a singer whom he
expected had not come, Oliver touched him on the arm.</p>

<p>"Miss Brooke is going to sing, please," he said. "Will
you announce her?"</p>

<p>Mr. Brooke stared hard for a moment, then bowed his
head.</p>

<p>"My daughter will now sing to you," he said, curtly,
and sat down again, grasping his brown beard with one
hand.</p>

<p>"<i>Can</i> she sing?" Mrs. Romaine said in his ear, with an
accent of veiled surprise.</p>

<p>"I do not know in the least. I hope it will be English,
at any rate. These good people don't care for French and
Italian things."</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine saw that he looked undoubtedly nervous,
and just then Oliver began the prelude to Lesley's song.
It was certainly English enough. It was "Home, Sweet
Home."</p>

<p>Every one looked up at the sound of the familiar air.
"Hackneyed" as Oliver had declared it to be, it is a song
which every audience loves to hear. And Lesley made a
pretty picture for the eyes to rest upon while she sang.
She was dressed from top to toe in a delicate shade of
grey, which suited her fair skin admirably: the grey was
relieved by some broad white ribbons and a vest of soft<a name="Page_126"></a>
white silk folds, according to the prevailing fashion. A
wide-brimmed grey hat, trimmed with drooping grey ostrich
feathers, also became her extremely well. Mrs. Romaine
noticed that Caspar Brooke looked at her hard for a minute
or two, and then sat with his eyes fixed on the ground, his
right hand forming a pillow for his left elbow, and his left
hand engaged in stroking his big brown beard. What she
did not notice was, that Maurice Kenyon had withdrawn
himself to a post behind Mr. Brooke's chair, where he
could see and not be seen; and that his eyes were riveted
upon the fair singer with an expression which betokened
more perplexity than admiration.</p>

<p>As Lesley's pure, sweet notes floated out upon the air,
there was an instant stir of approbation and interest among
the listeners. If the girl had been less intent upon her
singing, the unmoved and unmoving stare of these men
and women might have made her a little nervous. It was
their way of showing attention. The men had even put
down their pipes. But Lesley did not see them. She had
chosen her song at haphazard, as one which these people
were likely to understand; but its painful appropriateness
to her own case, perhaps to her mother's case as well, only
came home to her as she continued it.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="firstline">"'Mid pleasures and palaces&mdash;though I may roam&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Be it never so humble, there's no place like home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">A charm from the heart seems to hallow it there,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which, seek through the world, is not met with elsewhere."<br></span>
</div>

<p>If Lesley's voice faltered a little while singing words with
which she herself felt forced to disagree, and to which her
mother had given the lie by running away from the home
Caspar Brooke had provided for her, the hesitation and
tremulousness were set down by the hearers as a very
pretty bit of artistic skill, which they were not at all slow
to appreciate. Mrs. Romaine put up her eye-glass and
looked narrowly at the girl during the last few notes.</p>

<p>"How well she sings!" she murmured in Mr. Brooke's
ear. "Positively, as if she felt it!"</p>

<p>Caspar Brooke gave a little start, left off handling his
beard, and sat up shrugging his shoulders. "A good deal
of dramatic talent, I fancy," he observed. But he could
say no more, for the people were clapping their hands and
stamping with their feet, in their eagerness for another<a name="Page_127"></a>
song; and he was obliged to be silent until the tumult
abated.</p>

<p>"You must sing again?" said Oliver.</p>

<p>"Must I? Really? But&mdash;shall I sing what English
people call a sacred piece? A Sunday piece, you know?
'Angels ever bright and fair'&mdash;can you play that?"</p>

<p>Oliver could play that. And Lesley sang it with great
applause.</p>

<p>But, being a keenly observant young person, and also in
a very sensitive state, she noticed that her father held aloof
and did not look quite well pleased. And she, remembering
her refusal to take singing lessons, felt, naturally, a
little guilty.</p>

<p>She had not time, however, to dwell upon her own feelings.
The assembly began to disperse, for Mr. Brooke did
not let the hours of his "meeting" encroach on church
hours, and it was time to go. But almost every man, and
certainly every woman, insisted on shaking hands with
Lesley, most of them saying, with a friendly nod, that they
hoped she'd come again.</p>

<p>"You're Mr. Brooke's daughter, ain't you, miss?" said
a tall, broad-shouldered fellow, with honest eyes and a
pleasant smile, which Lesley liked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am."</p>

<p>"I hope you'll give us a bit of your singing another
Sunday. 'Tis a treat to hear you, it is."</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall be glad to come again," said Lesley.</p>

<p>"That's like your father's daughter," said the man,
heartily. "Meaning no disrespect to you, miss. But Mr.
Brooke's the life and soul of this place: he's splendid&mdash;just
splendid; and we can't think too high of him. So it's
right and fitting that his daughter should take after him."</p>

<p>Lesley stood confused, but pleased. And then the man
lowered his voice and spoke confidentially.</p>

<p>"There was a bit of a breeze this afternoon, just after
you came in, I think; but you mustn't suppose that we
have trouble o' that sort every Sunday, or week-day either.
It was just one low, blackguardly fellow that got in and
wanted to make a disturbance. But he won't do it again,
for we'll have a meeting, and turn him out to-morrow. I
would just like you to understand, miss, that a good few
of us in this here club would pretty nigh lay down our
lives for Mr. Brooke if he wanted them&mdash;for myself I<a name="Page_128"></a>
wouldn't even say 'pretty nigh,' for I'd do it in a jiffy.
He's helped to save some of us from worse than death,
miss, and that's why."</p>

<p>"Come, Jim Gregson," said a cheery voice behind him,
"you get along home to your tea. Time for shutting up
just now. Good-bye."</p>

<p>And Caspar Brooke held out his hand for the workman
to shake. He had only just come up, and could not therefore
have heard what Gregson was saying; but Lesley preferred
to turn away without meeting his eye. For in truth
her own were full of tears.</p>

<p>She broke away from the little group, and went into the
library, as if she wanted to inspect the books. But in
reality she wanted a moment's silence and loneliness in
which to get rid of the swelling in her throat, the tears in
her eyes. These were caused partly by excitement, partly
by an expression of feeling brought to her by the earnestness
of Gregson's words, partly by penitence. And it was
before she had well got rid of them that Maurice Kenyon
put his head into the room and found her there.</p>

<p>"We are going now, Miss Brooke," he said. "Will you
come? I&mdash;I hope I'm not disturbing you&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am just coming," said Lesley, dashing the tears from
her face. "I am quite ready."</p>

<p>"There is no hurry. You can let them go on first, if
you like," said Maurice, partly closing the door. Then,
in the short pause that followed, he advanced a little way
into the room.</p>

<p>"Miss Brooke," he said, "I hope you will not mind my
speaking to you again; but I want to say that I wish&mdash;most
humbly and with all my heart&mdash;to beg your pardon.
Will you forgive me?"<a name="Page_129"></a></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">MAURICE KENYON'S APOLOGY.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Lesley</span> stood irresolute. In the other room she heard
the sound of voices calling her own name. "We are just
going, Lesley," she heard Mrs. Romaine say. She made
a hurried step towards the door.</p>

<p>"I can't stop," she said. "They will go without me."</p>

<p>"What if they do?" asked Mr. Kenyon. "I'll see you
home."</p>

<p>Lesley looked amazed, as well she might, at this masterful
way of settling the question. And while she hesitated
Maurice acted, as he usually did.</p>

<p>He strode to the door and spoke to Miss Brooke. "I
am just showing your niece some of the books: I'll follow
in a minute or two with her if you'll kindly walk on. It
won't take me more than a minute."</p>

<p>"Then we may as well wait," said Oliver's voice.</p>

<p>Lesley would have been very angry if she had known
what happened then. Mr. Kenyon, by means of energetic
pantomime, conveyed to the quick perceptions of Doctor
Sophy a knowledge of the fact that Lesley was a little agitated
and overcome, and that he was soothing her. And
that the departure of the rest of the party would be a
blessed relief.</p>

<p>Aunt Sophy was good-natured, and she had complete
trust in Maurice Kenyon.</p>

<p>"Don't stay more than a minute or two," she said.
"We'll just walk on then&mdash;Caspar and I. Mr. Trent is,
of course, escorting your sister. Mrs. Romaine will
come with us, and you'll follow?"</p>

<p>"I am quite ready," said Lesley.</p>

<p>"All right," answered Maurice, easily, "I must first
show you this book." Then he returned to the library,
and she heard the sounds of retreating steps and voices as
her father and his party left the building.<a name="Page_130"></a></p>

<p>"You have no book to show me&mdash;you had better come
at once," Lesley said, severely. But Mr. Kenyon arrested
her.</p>

<p>"I assure you I have. Look here: the men clubbed
together a little while ago and presented your father's
works to the library, all bound, you see, in vellum. I
need not mention that <i>he</i> had not thought it worth while
to give his own books to the club."</p>

<p>He showed her the volumes with pride, as if the presentation
had been made to a member of his own family.
Lesley touched the books with gentle fingers and reverent
eyes. "I have been reading 'The Unexplored,'" she said.</p>

<p>"I knew you would! And I knew you would like it!&mdash;I
am not wrong?"</p>

<p>"I like it very much. But it is all new to me&mdash;so new&mdash;I
feel like Ione when she first heard of the miseries of
England&mdash;I have lived in an enchanted world, where everything
of that sort was kept from me; so&mdash;<i>how</i> could I
understand?"</p>

<p>"I know! I know!&mdash;You make me doubly ashamed of
myself. I have lived, metaphorically, in dust and ashes
ever since we had that talk together. Miss Brooke, I
must have seemed to you the most intolerable prig! Can
you ever forgive me for what I said?"</p>

<p>"But," said Lesley, looking straight into his face with
her clear brown eyes, "if what you said was true?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I had no right to say it."</p>

<p>"That is true," Lesley answered, coldly; and she turned
about as though she did not wish to pursue the subject.</p>

<p>"But can you not forgive me for it? I was unjustifiably
angry I confess; but since I confess it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Kenyon, we ought to be going home. I see the
woman is waiting to put the lights out."</p>

<p>"We will go home if you like&mdash;certainly," said Maurice,
in a tone of vexed disappointment. "Take care of the
step&mdash;yes, here is the door. I am afraid we cannot get a
cab in this neighborhood; but as soon as we reach a
more civilized locality, I will do my best to find one for
you."</p>

<p>By this time they were in the yard. Night had already
fallen on the city, whether it had done so in the country
or not. The lamps were lighted in the streets; a murky
fog had settled like a pall upon the roads; and in the Sun<a name="Page_131"></a>day
silence the church bells rang out with a mournful
cadence which affected Lesley's spirits.</p>

<p>"London is a terrible place," she said, with a little shiver.</p>

<p>"Can you say that," he asked, looking at her curiously,
"after seeing the good work that is being done here? If it
is a terrible place, it is also a very noble and inspiring one."</p>

<p>"I know I am ignorant," said Lesley, heavily. "It
seems terrible to me."</p>

<p>They were silent for a minute or two, for they were passing
out of the yard belonging to the "model dwellings,"
as Macclesfield Buildings were called, into the squalid
street beyond; and in avoiding the group of loafers smoking
the pipe of idleness, and enjoying the comfortable
repose of sloth, Lesley and Mr. Kenyon were so far separated
that conversation became impossible.</p>

<p>"You had better take my arm," said Maurice, shortly,
almost sternly. "You must, indeed: the place is not fit
for you. I ought to have gone out and got a cab."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I do not need it. I can walk quite well.
What other people do, I suppose I can do as well."</p>

<p>"Miss Brooke, you have not forgiven me."</p>

<p>Lesley was silent.</p>

<p>"What can I say? I have no justification. I simply
let my tongue and my temper run away with me. I am
cursed with a hot temper: I do not think before I speak;
but I never intended to hurt you, Miss Brooke, I am sure
of that."</p>

<p>"No," said Lesley, very quietly, "I understand you.
If you had not thought me so stupid as not to see your
meaning, or so callous as not to care if I did, you would
not have spoken in that way. I don't know that your excuse
makes matters much better, Mr. Kenyon. But I am
not offended: you need not concern yourself."</p>

<p>"Then you ought to be offended," said Kenyon, doggedly.
"And I don't believe you."</p>

<p>"You don't believe me."</p>

<p>"No, indeed I don't."</p>

<p>Lesley's offence was so great now, whatever it had been
before, that it deprived her of the power of speech. Her
stately head went up: her mouth set itself in straight, hard
lines. Maurice saw these tokens, and interpreted them
aright.</p>

<p>"Don't be angry with me again. I mean that you could
not fail to despise me, to look down on me, for my want<a name="Page_132"></a>
of tact and sense. I thought that you did not understand
your father&mdash;I was vexed at that, because I have such a
respect, such an admiration for him&mdash;but I know now that
I was mistaken. You ought to be angry with me, for I
acknowledge that I spoke impertinently; but having been
angry, you can now be merciful and forgive. I apologize
from the bottom of my heart."</p>

<p>"How do you know that I understand my father? Why
have you changed your opinion?" said Lesley, coldly.
"You have nothing to go upon&mdash;just as in the other case
you had nothing to go upon. You rushed to one conclusion,
if you will excuse me for saying so, and now you rush
to another&mdash;with no better reason."</p>

<p>"You are very severe, Miss Brooke," said Maurice.
"But you are perfectly right, and I must not complain.
Only&mdash;if I may make a representation&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;I might point out that when I spoke to you first
you had not read your father's book, you had not, I believe,
even heard of it; that you knew nothing about the Macclesfield
Club, and that when I spoke to you about his
work amongst the poor you were very much inclined to
murmur, 'Can any good come out of Nazareth?'"</p>

<p>"Mr. Kenyon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Brooke, but isn't that substantially
true? If you can honestly say that it is a misapprehension
on my part, I won't say another word. But
isn't it all true?"</p>

<p>He turned his eager face and bright blue eyes towards
her, and read in her pale, troubled face a little of the conflict
that was going on between her candor and her pride.
"Now, what will she say?" he thought, with what would
have seemed to Lesley incomprehensible anxiety. "On
her answer depends my opinion of her, now and for ever."</p>

<p>And this appeared to Maurice quite an important matter,
though possibly Lesley might not have thought it so.</p>

<p>She turned to him at last with a frank, decisive gesture.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> true," she said. "I knew nothing about his books
or his works, and so how could I appreciate them? I had
never heard of 'The Unexplored' before. You are right,
and I had no business to be so angry. But how do you
know that I am different now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know you are," said Maurice, confidently. "You
have come to the club for one thing, you see; and you<a name="Page_133"></a>
sang to the people and looked at them&mdash;well, as if you
cared. And you have read 'The Unexplored' <i>now</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I have," said Lesley, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"And you like it?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I like it." The girl looked away, and went on
nervously, hesitatingly. "It is very well done," she said,
"It is very clever."</p>

<p>"Oh, if that is all you can find to say about it!"</p>

<p>"But isn't it a great deal?&mdash;Mr. Kenyon, I don't know
what to say about it. You see I can't be sure whether it
is all&mdash;true."</p>

<p>"True? The story? But, of course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course the <i>story</i> is not true. I am not such a goose
as that. But is the meaning of it true? the moral, so to
speak? Is there so much wickedness in the world as my
father says? So much vice and wealth and selfishness on
the one side: so much misery and poverty and crime on
the other? You are a doctor, and you must have seen a
great deal of London life: you ought to know. Is it an
exaggeration, or is it true?"</p>

<p>There was such intensity and such pathos in her tones
that Kenyon was silent for a minute or two, startled by the
vivid reality which she had attached to her father's views
and ideas. He could not have answered her lightly, even
if it had been in his nature to do so.</p>

<p>"Before God," he said, solemnly, "it is all true&mdash;every
word of it."</p>

<p>"Then what can we do," said Lesley, gently, "but go
down into the midst of it and help?"</p>

<p>Mr. Maurice Kenyon, being a man of ardent temperament,
always vows that he lost his heart to Lesley there
and then. It is possible that if she had not been a very
pretty girl, the most noble of sentiments might have fallen
unheeded from her lips; but as she was "so young, so
sweet, so delicately fair," Kenyon could not hear his own
opinions reciprocated without an answering thrill. How
delightful would it be to walk through life with a woman of
this kind by one's side! a woman, whose face was a picture,
whose every movement a poem, whose soul was as finely
touched to fine issues as that of an angel or a saint! All
these reflections rushed through his mind in an instant,
and it was almost a wonder that he did not blurt some of
them out at once. But Lesley went on speaking in a quiet,
pensive way.<a name="Page_134"></a></p>

<p>"I wonder whether I can do anything&mdash;while I am here.
I shall not have so very long a time, but I might try."</p>

<p>"Not so long a time, Miss Brooke? I thought you had
come home for good."</p>

<p>"Only for a year," said Lesley, coloring hotly. "Then
I go back to mamma."</p>

<p>Maurice said nothing at first. He felt the hand that
rested on his arm tremble slightly, and he knew that he
ought to make no more inquiries. But he could not refrain
from adding, almost jealously&mdash;</p>

<p>"You will be glad of that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! You do not know my mother?" said Lesley,
half shyly, half boldly.</p>

<p>"No, I never saw her."</p>

<p>"It is very hard to be so long away from her. She is so
sweet and good."</p>

<p>"But you have your father? You are learning to know
<i>him</i> now."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, but I want them <i>both</i>," said Lesley, with an
indescribably gentle and tender intonation. And as they
reached Euston Road and were obliged to leave off talking
while they threaded their way through the intricacies of
vehicular traffic, Mr. Kenyon was revolving in his mind a
new idea, namely, the possibility of a reconciliation between
Brooke and his wife. He had never thought much about
Lady Alice before: she seemed to him to have passed out
of Caspar Brooke's life entirely; and if it were not for this
link between the two&mdash;this sweet and noble-spirited and
lovely girl&mdash;she would not have been likely to come back
into it. But Lesley might perhaps reunite the two, and
Maurice's heart began to burn within him with fear for his
hero's happiness. Why should any Lady Alice trouble the
peace of a worker for mankind like Caspar Brooke?</p>

<p>They did not talk very much more on their way to Upper
Woburn Place. They found Ethel and Oliver standing on
the steps of Mr. Brooke's house, evidently waiting for the
truants. It struck Lesley as she came up that Oliver
Trent's brow was ominously dark, and that Ethel's pretty,
saucy face wore an expression of something like anxiety or
distress.</p>

<p>"We are almost tired of waiting for you, good people,"
she began merrily. "Fortunately it is fine and warm, or
we should have gone and left you to your own devices, as
Mr. Brooke and Rosalind have done."<a name="Page_135"></a></p>

<p>"Where have they gone?" asked Maurice.</p>

<p>"Walked off to her house. Miss Brooke is at home.
Lesley, you <i>are</i> an imposition! Think of having a voice
like that, and keeping it dark all this time."</p>

<p>"We shall requisition Miss Brooke for the club very
often, I know that," said Maurice.</p>

<p>"You'll come in with us, Lesley?" Ethel asked.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Ethel. Not to-day. Thanks."</p>

<p>She wondered a little nervously why Oliver was looking
so vexed and&mdash;yes, so miserable, too! He seemed terribly
out of spirits. Had he and Ethel quarrelled? The thought
gave a look of tender inquiry to her eyes as she held out
her hand to him. And on meeting that sweet glance,
Oliver's face brightened. He had been feeling an unreasonable
annoyance with her for walking home with Maurice
Kenyon, and had even in his heart called her "a little
French flirt." Though why it should matter to him that she
was a flirt, did not exactly appear.</p>

<p>They said good-bye to each other, and separated. Maurice
went off to see a patient; Oliver accompanied Ethel
to her own house; Lesley entered her own home.</p>

<p>She was alone for an hour or two, and, to tell the truth,
she felt rather dull. Miss Brooke went away to her circle
of select souls, and her father, as she knew, had gone to
Mrs. Romaine's. She took out her much-prized volume of
"The Unexplored," and began to read it again; wishing
that she could talk to her mother about it, and explain to
her how really great and good a man her father was. For&mdash;she
had got as far as this&mdash;she was sure that her mother
did not understand him. It would have been impossible
for him to do a mean, a cruel, a dishonorable action. There
had been a misunderstanding somewhere; and Lesley
wished, with her whole soul, that she could clear it up.</p>

<p>The sound of the opening and closing of the front door
did not arouse her from her dreams. She read on, holding
the little paper-covered volume on her lap, deep in deepest
thought, until the door of the drawing-room opened rather
suddenly, and her father walked in.</p>

<p>It was an unusual hour at which to see him in the
drawing-room, and Lesley looked up in surprise. Then,
half unconsciously, half timidly, she drew her filmy
embroidered handkerchief over the book in her lap. She
had a shy dislike to letting her father see what she was
reading.<a name="Page_136"></a></p>

<p>He did not seem, however, to take any notice of her
occupation. He walked straight to an arm-chair on the
opposite side of the hearth, sat down, stretching out his
long legs, and placing his elbows on the arms of the chair.
The unruly lock of hair, which no hairdresser could tame,
had fallen right across his broad brow, and heightened the
effect of a very undeniable frown. Mr. Caspar Brooke was
in anything but an amiable temper.</p>

<p>It was with a laudable attempt, however, to keep the
displeasure out of his voice that he said at length&mdash;</p>

<p>"I thought I understood you to say, Lesley, that you
were not musical!"</p>

<p>The color flushed Lesley's face to the very roots of her
hair.</p>

<p>"I do not think I am&mdash;very musical," she said, trying
to answer bravely. "I play the piano very little."</p>

<p>"Of course you must know that that is a quibble," said
Mr. Brooke, dryly. "A talent for music does not confine
itself solely to the piano. I presume that you have been
told that you have a good voice?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have been told so."</p>

<p>"And you have had lessons?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a few."</p>

<p>"Then may I ask what was your motive for declining to
take lessons in London when I asked to do so? You even
went so far as to make use of a subterfuge: you gave me
to understand that you had no musical power at all, and
that you knew nothing and could do nothing?"</p>

<p>He paused as if he expected a reply; but Lesley did not
say a word.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand it," Mr. Brooke went on; "but,"&mdash;after
a pause&mdash;"I suppose there is no reason why I
should. I did not come to say anything much about that
part of the business. I came rather to suggest that as you
have a good voice, it is wrong not to cultivate it. And
your lessons will give you something to do. It seems to
me rather a pity, my dear, that you should do nothing but
sit round and read novels&mdash;which, your aunt tells me, is
your principal occupation. Suppose you try to find something
more useful to do?"</p>

<p>He spoke with a smile now and in a softer voice; but
Lesley was much too hurt and depressed to say a word.
He looked at her steadfastly for a minute or two, and
decided that she was sullen.<a name="Page_137"></a></p>

<p>"I will see about the lessons for you," he said, getting
up and speaking decidedly, "and I hope you will make
the most of your opportunities. How much time have you
been in the habit of devoting to your singing every day?"</p>

<p>"An hour and a half," said Lesley, in a very low
voice.</p>

<p>"And you left off practising as soon as you came here?
That was a great pity; and you must allow me to say, Lesley,
very silly into the bargain. Surely your own conscience
tells you that it was wrong? A voice like yours is
not meant to be hidden."</p>

<p>Lesley wished that at that moment she could find any
voice at all. She sat like a statue, conscious only of an
effort to repress her tears. And Mr. Brooke, having said
all that he wanted to say, took up a book, and thought how
difficult it was to manage women who met remonstrances
in silence.</p>

<p>Lesley got up in a few moments and walked quietly out
of the room. But she forgot her book. It fell noiselessly
on the soft fur rug, and lay there, with leaves flattened and
back bent outwards. Caspar Brooke was one of the people
who cannot bear to see a book treated with anything less
than reverence. He picked it up, straightened the leaves,
and looked casually at the title. It was "The Unexplored."</p>

<p>He held it for a minute, gazing before him with wide
eyes as if he were troubled or perplexed. Then he shook
his head, sighed, smiled, and put it down upon the nearest
table. "Poor little girl!" he said. "I wonder if I frightened
her at all!"<a name="Page_138"></a></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">AT MRS. ROMAINE'S.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> reason why Caspar Brooke spoke somewhat sharply
to Lesley was not far to seek. He had been to Mrs. Romaine's
house to tea. The sequence of cause and effect
can easily be conjectured.</p>

<p>"How charmingly your daughter sang!" Mrs. Romaine
began, when she had got Mr. Brooke into his favorite corner,
and given him a cup of her best China tea.</p>

<p>"Yes, she sang very well," said Brooke, carelessly.</p>

<p>"I had no idea that she <i>could</i> sing! Why, by the bye&mdash;did
you not tell me that she said she was not musical?&mdash;declined
singing lessons, and so on?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I said so. Yes, she did."</p>

<p>"She must be very modest!" said Mrs. Romaine, lifting
her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I fancy she did not want to be indebted
to me for more than she could help."</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine looked pained, and kept for a few moments
a pained silence.</p>

<p>"My poor friend!" she said at last. "This is very sad!
Could she"&mdash;and Brooke knew that the pronoun referred
to Lady Alice, not to Lesley&mdash;"could she not be content
with abandoning you, without poisoning your daughter's
mind against you?"</p>

<p>Caspar said nothing. He leaned forward, tea-cup in
hand, and studied the carpet. It was, perhaps, hard for
him to find a suitable reply.</p>

<p>"It is too much," Rosalind continued, with increasing
energy. "You have taken not a daughter, but an enemy
into your house. She sits and criticizes all you do&mdash;sends
accounts to her mother, doubtless, of all your comings and
goings. She looks upon you as a tyrant, and a disreputable
person, <a name="tn_143"></a><!-- TN: Comma changed to period after "too"-->too. She has been taught to hate you, and
she carries out the teaching&mdash;oh, I can see it in every line
of her face, every inflection of her voice: she has been<a name="Page_139"></a>
taught to loathe you, my poor, misjudged friend, and she
does not disguise her loathing!"</p>

<p>It is not quite pleasant for a man to hear that his daughter
hates him, and makes no secret of the hatred. Caspar
immediately concluded that Lesley had made some outspoken
remarks upon the subject to Mrs. Romaine.
Secretly he felt hurt and angry: outwardly he smiled.</p>

<p>"What would you have?" he said, lightly but bitterly.
"Lady Alice has no doubt indoctrinated her daughter, as
you say; all that I can expect from Lesley is civility. And
I generally get that."</p>

<p>"Civility? Between father and daughter? When she
ought to be proud of such a father&mdash;proud of all that you
are, and all that you have done! She should be adoring
you, slaving for you, ready to sacrifice herself at your
smallest word&mdash;and see what she is! A machine, silent,
useless, unwilling&mdash;from whom all that you can claim is&mdash;civility!
Oh, women are capable sometimes of taking a
terrible revenge!"</p>

<p>She threw her hands out with a gesture of despair and
deprecation, which was really fine in its way; then she
rose from her chair, went to the mantelpiece, and stood
with her face bent upon her clasped hands. Caspar rose
too, and stood on the hearthrug beside her, looking down
at the pretty ruffled head, with something very like affection
in his eye.</p>

<p>He did not quite understand this emotion of hers, but
its sincerity touched as well as puzzled him. For she was
sincere as far as he was concerned, and this sincerity gave
her a certain amount of power, such as sincerity always
gives. The ring of true feeling in her voice could not be
counterfeited, and Caspar was flattered by it, as any man
would have been flattered at having excited so much sympathy
in the heart of a talented and beautiful woman.</p>

<p>He knew that Alice had been jealous of Rosalind Romaine,
but, he thought, quite unreasonably so. Poor Rosalind, tied
to a dry old stick of a husband, to whom she did her duty
most thoroughly, was naturally glad to talk now and then
to a man who knew something of Art and Life. That was
simple enough, and he had been glad of her interest and
sympathy, especially as these were denied to him by his
wife. There was nothing for Lady Alice to be jealous
about. And he had dismissed the matter impatiently from<a name="Page_140"></a>
his thoughts. Alice had left him because she hated his
opinions, his manner of life, his profession&mdash;not because
she was jealous of Rosalind Romaine. But Rosalind knew
better.</p>

<p>The woman's sympathy affected him so far, however,
that, after standing silent for a minute or two, he laid his
hand softly upon her arm. It was a foolish thing to do,
but then Caspar Brooke was never a particularly wise man,
in spite of his goodness of heart and fertility of brain. And
Rosalind felt, by the thrill that ran through her at his touch,
that she had gained more from him than she had ever
gained before. What would he say next?</p>

<p>Well, he did not say very much. "Your sympathy,
Rosalind," he said, "is very pleasant&mdash;very dear to me.
But you must not give me too much of it. Sympathy is
enervating, as other men have found before me!"</p>

<p>"May I not offer you mine?" she said, plaintively. "It
is so hard to be silent! If only I could make Lesley understand
what you are&mdash;how noble&mdash;how good&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Caspar laughed, and took away his hand.
"Don't talk to her about me; it would do no good," he
said.</p>

<p>He stood in the firelight, looking so massive, so stern, so
resolved, that Mrs. Romaine lost herself for a moment in
admiration of his great frame and leonine head. And as
she paused he spoke again.</p>

<p>"I have not lately observed much hostility to myself in
Lesley's demeanor," he said. "At first, of course&mdash;but
lately&mdash;well, I have been more struck by a sort of languor,
a want of interest and comprehension, than anything else.
No doubt she feels that she is in a new world&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah yes, a world of intellect and activity to which she
has not been accustomed," said Mrs. Romaine, briskly.
Since Caspar had removed his hand she had been standing
erect, watchfully observant of him. It was by his moods
that she intended to regulate her own. "I suppose she
has been accustomed to nothing but softness and self-indulgence;
and she does not understand this larger life to
which she now has access."</p>

<p>"Poor child!" said Mr. Brooke.</p>

<p>But this was not at all the remark that Mrs. Romaine
wanted him to make. She tried to beat back the tide of
paternal affection that was evidently setting in.<a name="Page_141"></a></p>

<p>"She wants rousing I am afraid. She ought not to be
allowed to sink into a dreamy, listless state. It must be
very trying for you to see it; you must be pained by the
selfishness and waywardness from which it proceeds&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think it does?" said Mr. Brooke, almost wistfully.
"I should be sorry to think Lesley selfish. Sophy
says that she is more ignorant than selfish."</p>

<p>"But what is ignorance save a form of selfishness?"
cried Rosalind, indignantly. "She might know if she
chose! She does know the common duties of humanity,
the duty of every man or woman to labor for others, to gain
knowledge, to make broad the borders of light! Oh, I
cannot bear to hear ignorance alleged as an excuse for
self-love! It is impossible that any one with Lesley's
faculties should not see her duty, even if she is idle and
indifferent enough to let it pass when she does see it."</p>

<p>Mr. Brooke sat down, regardless of the fact that Mrs.
Romaine was standing, and looked at the carpet again with
a sigh.</p>

<p>"You may be right," he said, in a pained tone; "but if
so, what am I to do?"</p>

<p>"You must speak to her," said Rosalind, energetically.
"You must tell her not to be idle and obstinate and wayward:
you must show her her duty, so that she may have
no excuse for neglecting it."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"That's not a man's duty, it seems to me. Woman to
woman, man to man. I wish you would do it, Rosalind!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I have not a <i>mother's</i> right," said she, softly.</p>

<p>But the remark had an effect which she had not anticipated.</p>

<p>"That is true. It is a mother who should tell a girl her
duty. Poor Lesley's mother has not done all that she
might do in that respect. Our unhappy quarrel has caused
her to represent me to the girl in very dark colors, I believe.
But I have lately been wondering whether that might not
be amended. Did you hear that man's taunt this afternoon&mdash;about
the wife that had left me? I can't endure
that sort of thing. Think of the harm it does. And then
the child must needs go and sing 'Home, Sweet Home.'
To me, whose home was broken up by <i>her</i> mother. I had
the greatest possible difficulty in sitting through that song,
Rosalind. And I said to myself that I was a great fool to
put up with this state of things."<a name="Page_142"></a></p>

<p>His sentences were unusually short, his tones abrupt;
both covered an amount of agitation which Mrs. Romaine
had not expected to see. She sat down and remained
silent and motionless: she even held her breath, not well
knowing what to expect. Presently he resumed, in a lower
tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know that if I alter existing arrangements I shall
give myself some pain and discomfort, and inflict more,
perhaps, upon others; but I think this is inevitable. I am
determined, if possible, to end my solitary life, and the
solitary life also of a woman who is&mdash;I may say it now&mdash;dear
to me." He spoke with deliberate gravity. Mrs.
Romaine's pulses beat faster: the hot color began to steal
into her cheeks. "I never wished to inflict pain upon her.
I have always regretted the years of separation and loneliness
that we have both spent. So I have resolved&mdash;perhaps
that is too strong a word&mdash;I am thinking of asking
her to share my home with me again."</p>

<p>"Again?" The word escaped Rosalind's lips before she
knew that she had spoken.</p>

<p>"Yes, once again," said Caspar, quite unconscious of
her emotion. "We did not get on very well when we lived
together, but we are older now, and I think that if we made
a fresh start it <i>might</i> be possible&mdash;I wonder if Alice would
consent?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause. Then&mdash;"You think of
asking Lady Alice to come back to you?" said Mrs. Romaine,
in a hard, measured voice, which made Caspar
look at her with some transient feeling of surprise. But
he put down the change of tone to her astonishment at his
proposition, and went on unmoved.</p>

<p>"I thought of it&mdash;yes. It would be much better for
Lesley."</p>

<p>"Are you so devoted to Lesley that you want to sacrifice
your whole life for her?" asked Rosalind, in the same hard,
strained voice.</p>

<p>"My whole life? Well, no&mdash;but you exaggerate, Rosalind.
I do not sacrifice my whole life by having my wife
and daughter in my house."</p>

<p>"That is plausibly said. But one has to consider what
sort of wife and daughter yours are, and what part of your
life will have to be devoted to them."<a name="Page_143"></a></p>

<p>Brooke sat and stroked his beard. He began to wish
that he had not mentioned his project to Mrs. Romaine.
But he could not easily tell her to hold her tongue.</p>

<p>"I am not going to presume," said Rosalind, "to say
anything unkind&mdash;anything harsh of your wife: I know
I have not the right, and I know that you would&mdash;very
properly&mdash;resent it. So don't be afraid. But I only want
to remind you that Lady Alice is not even where she was
when, as an over-sensitive, easily-offended girl, she fled from
you. She has had twelve years of life under conditions
differing most entirely from yours. She has lived in the
fashionable world&mdash;a world which of all others you dislike.
What sympathy can there be between you? She may be
perfect in her own line, but it is not your line: you are
different; and you will never be happy together."</p>

<p>"That is a hard thing to say, Rosalind."</p>

<p>"It will be a harder thing for you if you try it. Believe
me, Caspar"&mdash;her voice trembled as she used his Christian
name, which she very seldom did&mdash;"believe me that if it
would be for your happiness I would welcome the change!
But when I remember the discord, the incompatibility, the
want of sympathy, which used to grieve me in those old
days, I cannot think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped short, and put her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>

<p>"Lady Alice could not understand you&mdash;could not
appreciate you," she said. "And it was hard&mdash;hard for
your friends to look on and say&mdash;<i>nothing</i>!"</p>

<p>Brooke rose abruptly from his chair. "No one ever
had a truer friend than I have in you," he said, huskily.
"But it seems to me that Alice may have changed with the
lapse of years; she may have become easier to satisfy,
better able to sympathize&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Does she show that spirit in the way she has spoken
of you to your daughter? What do you gather from Lesley
as to her state of mind?" said Mrs. Romaine, keenly.</p>

<p>He paused. She knew very well that the question was
a hard one for him to answer.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, with a heavy sigh, "you know as well as
I do."</p>

<p>Then he turned aside, and for an instant or two there
was a silence.</p>

<p>"I suppose it would not be wise," he continued, at last.
"But I wish that it could have been done. It would be<a name="Page_144"></a>
better in many ways. A man and wife ought to live
together. A girl ought to live with her parents. We are
all in false positions. And, perhaps, if any one is to be
sacrificed, it ought to be myself," he said, with a curious
smile.</p>

<p>"You forget," said Mrs. Romaine with emotion, "that
you sacrifice others in sacrificing yourself."</p>

<p>"Others? No, I don't think so. You allude to my
sister?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not your sister."</p>

<p>"Sophy could go on living with us and managing the
household affairs," said Brooke, who had no conception
of what poor Mrs. Romaine meant; "and she is not a
person who would willingly interfere with other people's
views or opinions. Indeed, she carries the <i>laisser-faire</i>
principle almost to an extreme. Sophy is no proselytizer,
thank God!"</p>

<p>"I did not mean Sophy: I meant your friends&mdash;old
friends like myself," said Rosalind, desperately. "You
will cast us all off&mdash;you will forget us&mdash;forget&mdash;<i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>There was unusual passion in her voice. Then she hid
her face in her hands and burst into tears. Brooke made
two steps towards her, and stopped short.</p>

<p>"Rosalind!" he exclaimed. "You cannot think that!
you cannot think that I shall ever forget old friends!"</p>

<p>Then he halted, and stood looking down at her, and
biting his beard, which he was crushing up to his lips with
one hand, after his fashion when he was embarrassed or
perplexed. Some glimmer of the truth had begun to manifest
itself to him. A hot, red flush crossed his brow.</p>

<p>"Rosalind," he said, in a softer but also a colder tone,
"you must not take this matter so much to heart. Rest
assured that I&mdash;and my wife, if she comes back, and my
daughter also&mdash;will always look upon you as a very dear
and valued friend."</p>

<p>"I am so alone in the world," she said, wiping away her
tears and slightly lifting her head. "I cannot bear to think
that the day will come when I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused&mdash;perhaps purposely. But Caspar was resolved
to treat the subject more lightly now.</p>

<p>"When you are without friends? Oh, that will never
be. You are too kind and sympathetic to be without as
many friends as you choose to have."</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;yourself&mdash;&mdash;"<a name="Page_145"></a></p>

<p>"Oh, I am of a very constant disposition," he said,
cheerfully. "I suppose it is for that reason that I want
Alice back. You know that in spite of all our disagreements,
I have always held to it that I never saw a woman
half as charming, half as attractive, as Alice."</p>

<p>This was a speech not calculated to soothe Mrs. Romaine's
wounded feelings, or to implant in her a liking for
Lady Alice. For Mrs. Romaine was not very generous,
and she was irritated by the thought that she had betrayed
her own secret. She rose to her feet at once, with a quick
and rather haughty gesture.</p>

<p>"You are indeed a model of constancy," she said.
"Some men would resent insults, even if offered to them
by wives. You are capable, it seems, of much forgetfulness
and much forgiveness."</p>

<p>"Do you think that a fault?" asked Brooke, calmly.
Her mood changed at once. She burst into a shrill
little laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all. Most convenient&mdash;for the wife. There
is one danger&mdash;you may incur the censure of more worldly
men; but then you are too high-minded to care for that!"</p>

<p>Caspar shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>"I think I can take care of myself," he said, good-humoredly.
"And now I must go. Pray don't distress
yourself on my account. I will not do anything rash."</p>

<p>They stood facing each other, she with her eyes down, he
looking straight into her face. Some instinct told her not
to break the spell by looking up. There was a conflict
going on in Caspar Brooke's mind&mdash;a conflict between pity
(not love) and duty. He was a tender-hearted man, and
it would have been very easy to him just then to have given
her some friendly, comforting words, or <a name="tn_150"></a><!--TN: Quote removed after "even&mdash;&mdash;"-->even&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes, he acknowledged to himself, he would have liked
to kiss those soft lips of hers, those downcast eyelids,
slightly reddened by recent tears! And he did not think
that she would resent the caress.</p>

<p>But how could he ask his wife to return to him if he did
this thing? As he had indicated by his words, he still
loved Lady Alice. He had the courage to be faithful to
her, too. For Caspar Brooke was a man of strong convictions,
steadfast will, and stainless honor. However great
the temptation might be, he was not going to do a thing
that he knew he should afterwards regret.<a name="Page_146"></a></p>

<p>"Good-bye, Mrs. Romaine."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Mr. Brooke."</p>

<p>So they took leave of each other; and Rosalind went to
bed with a bad headache, while Caspar Brooke returned
home to find fault with his daughter Lesley.<a name="Page_147"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">THE WIFE OF FRANCIS TRENT.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Far</span> away from the eminently respectable quarter of London,
adorned by the habitation of families like the
Brookes, the Kenyons, and the Romaines, you may find
an unsavory district in Whitechapel which is known as
Truefit Row. It is a street of tall and mean-looking
houses, which seem to be toppling to their fall; and the
pavement is strewn with garbage which is seldom cleared
away. Many of the windows of the houses are broken;
many of the doors hang ajar, for the floors are let out in
flats, and there is a common stair for at least five and
twenty families. It is a dreary-looking place, and the
dwellers therein look as dreary as their own abode.</p>

<p>In one of these houses Mr. Francis Trent had found a
resting-place for the sole of his foot. It was not a fashionable
lodging, not even a particularly clean one; but he
had come down in the world, and did not very much care
where he lived, so long as he had plenty to drink, and a
little money in his pockets. But these commodities were
not as plentiful as he wanted them to be. Therefore he
passed a good deal of his time in a state of chronic brooding
and discontent.</p>

<p>He had one room on the third storey. The woodwork
of this apartment was so engrained with grime that scarcely
any amount of washing would have made it look clean;
but it had certainly been washed within a comparatively
recent date. The wall paper, which had peeled off in certain
places, had also been repaired by a careful hand; and
the curtains which shaded the unbroken window were
almost spotlessly clean. By several other indications it
was quite plain that a woman's hand had lately been busy
in the room; and compared with many other rooms in the
same building, it was quite a palace of cleanliness and
comfort.</p>

<p>But Francis Trent did not think so. He sat over his
small and smouldering fire one dark November afternoon,<a name="Page_148"></a>
and shivered, partly from cold and partly from disgust.
He had no coals left, and no money wherewith to buy
them: a few sticks and some coke and cinders were the
materials out of which he was trying to make a fire, and
naturally the result was not very inspiriting. The kettle,
which was standing on the dull embers, showed not the
slightest inclination to "sing." Francis Trent, outstretched
on a basket-chair (the only comfortable article of furniture
that the room contained), gave the fire an occasional stir
with his foot, and bestowed upon it a deal of invective.</p>

<p>"It will be out directly," he said at last, sitting up and
looking dismally about him; "and it's nearly five o'clock.
She said she would be here at four. Ugh! how cold it is!
If she doesn't come in five minutes I shall go to the Spotted
Dog. There's always a fire there, thank goodness, and
they'll stand me a glass of <a name="tn_153"></a><!-- TN: "sonething" changed to "something"-->something hot, I daresay."</p>

<p>He rose and walked about the room by way of relieving
the monotony of existence, and causing his blood to circulate
a little faster. But this mode of activity did not
long please him, and he threw himself back in his chair at
last, and uttered an exclamation of disgust.</p>

<p>"Confound it! I shall go out," he said to himself.</p>

<p>But just at that moment a hand fumbled at the latch.
He called out "Come in," an unnecessary call, because the
door was half open before he spoke, and a woman entered
the room, shutting the door behind her.</p>

<p>She was slight, trim, not very tall: she had a pale face
and dark eyes, dark, glossy hair, and delicate features. If
Lesley had been there, she would have recognized in this
woman the ladies' maid who called herself Mary Kingston.
But in this part of the world she was known as Mrs.
Trent.</p>

<p>Francis did not give her a warm welcome, and yet his
weak, worn face lighted up a little at the sight of her. "I
thought you were never coming," he said, grumblingly, and
his eyes fell greedily to the basket that she carried on her
arm. "What have you <a name="tn_153a"></a><!-- TN: "got" changed to "get"-->got there?"</p>

<p>"Just a few little things for your tea," said Mary, depositing
the basket on the table. "And, oh&mdash;what a wretched
fire! Have you no coals?"</p>

<p>"Neither coals nor food nor drink," he answered, sullenly,
"nor money in my pocket either."</p>

<p>The woman stood and looked at him. "You had two
pounds the day before yesterday," she said.<a name="Page_149"></a></p>

<p>"Billiards," he answered, laconically. But he turned
away so as not to see her face.</p>

<p>She gave a short, sharp exclamation. "You promised
to be careful!"</p>

<p>"The luck was against me," he said. "I thought I
should win, but my hand's taken to shaking so much that
I couldn't play. I don't see why you should blame me&mdash;I've
precious few amusements."</p>

<p>She did not answer, but began to take the parcels, one
by one, from her basket, and place them on the table. Her
own hands shook a little as she did so. Francis turned
again to watch her operations. She took out some tea,
bread, butter, eggs, and bacon. There was a bottle of
brandy and a bundle of cigars. Francis Trent's eyes glistened
at the sight. He stole closer to his wife, and put
his arm around her.</p>

<p>"You're a good soul, Mary. You'll forgive me, won't
you? Upon my honor, I never meant to lose the money."</p>

<p>"I have to work hard enough for it," she said dryly.</p>

<p>"I know you have! It's a shame&mdash;a d&mdash;&mdash;d shame!
If I had my way, you should be dressed in satin, and sit
all day with your hands before you, and ride in your own
carriage&mdash;you know you should!"</p>

<p>"I don't know that I should particularly care about that
kind of life," said Mary, still coldly, but with a perceptible
softening of her eye and relaxation of the stiff upper lip.
"I would rather live on a farm in the country, and do farm-work.
It's healthier, yes, and it's happier&mdash;to my thinking."</p>

<p>"So it is; and that's the life we'll lead by and by, when
Oliver pays us what he has promised," said Francis, eagerly.
"We will have some land of our own, and get far away
from the temptation of the city. Then you will see what
a different fellow I'll be, Mary. You shan't have reason
to complain of me then."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope so, Francis," she said, but not too hopefully.
Perhaps she noticed that his hand and eye both
strayed, as if involuntarily, towards the bottle of spirits on
the table. And at that moment, the last flicker of light
from the fire went out.</p>

<p>"Have you no candles?" she asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Not one."</p>

<p>"I'll go out and fetch them, and some coal too. Sit
down quietly, and wait. I won't be long. And as I<a name="Page_150"></a>
haven't a corkscrew, I'll take the bottle with me, and get
it opened downstairs."</p>

<p>Francis dared not object, but his wife's course of action
made him sulky. He did not see why she should not have
left him the bottle during her absence: he could have
broken its neck on the fender. But he knew very well
that she could not trust him to drink only in moderation
if he were left alone with the bottle; and, like a wise
woman, she therefore took it with her.</p>

<p>She was back again in a few minutes, bringing with her
fuel and lights. Francis was lying in his bed, his face
turned sullenly to the wall. Mary poured a little brandy
into a glass, and brought it to him to drink.</p>

<p>"You will feel better when you have had that," she said,
"and you shall have some more in your tea if you want it.
Now, I'm going to light up the fire."</p>

<p>So well did she perform her task that in a very short
time the flames were leaping up the chimney, the shadows
dancing cheerfully over the ceiling, the kettle hissing and
puffing on the fire. The sight and sound drew Francis
once more from his bed to the basket chair, where he sat
and lazily watched his wife as she cut bread, made tea,
fried bacon and eggs, with the ease and celerity of a
woman to whom domestic offices are familiar. When at
last the tea-table was arranged, he drew up his chair to it
with a sigh of positive pleasure.</p>

<p>"How homelike and comfortable it looks: Why don't
you always stay with me, Mary, and keep me straight?"</p>

<p>"You want so much keeping straight, Francis," she said,
but a slight smile flickered about the comers of her lips.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of the pair that he allowed her to
wait on him, hand and foot: he let her cut the bread, pour
out the tea, carry his plate backwards and forwards, and
pour the brandy into his cup, without a word of remonstrance.
Only when he had been well supplied and was not
likely to want anything more just then, did he say to
her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mary, and get yourself a cup of tea."</p>

<p>Mary did not seem to resent the condescending nature
of this invitation. She thanked him simply, and sat down;
pouring out for herself the dregs of the tea, and eating a
piece of dry bread with it. Francis had the grace to remonstrate
with her on the poverty of her fare.<a name="Page_151"></a></p>

<p>"It doesn't matter what I eat now," she said. "I have
the best of everything where I'm living, and I don't feel
hungry."</p>

<p>"I hope you're comfortable where you are," said Mr.
Trent, politely.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm very comfortable, thank you, Francis.
Though," said Mrs. Trent, deliberately, "I think I should
be more comfortable if I wasn't in a house where Mr.
Oliver visited."</p>

<p>"Oliver! Do you mean my brother Oliver? Why do
you call him <i>Mr.</i> Oliver? It is so absurd to keep up these
class-distinctions."</p>

<p>"So I think," said Mary, "but when other people keep
them up it's not much use for me to be the first to cast
them over board. Your brother Oliver comes to the house
where I'm living much oftener than I think he ought."</p>

<p>"What house is it? You never told me."</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Brooke's. Mr. Caspar Brooke&mdash;him as wrote
'The Unexplored.' I brought it to you to read, I remember&mdash;a
good long time ago."</p>

<p>"Awful rot it was too!" said Francis, contemptuously.
"However, I suppose it paid. What are you doing there?
Wasn't it his wife who ran away from him? I remember
the row some years ago&mdash;before I went under. Is she
dead?"</p>

<p>"No, she's living with her father, Lord Courtleroy. It's
her daughter I've come to wait on: Miss Lesley Brooke."</p>

<p>"Brooke's daughter!" said Francis, thoughtfully. "I
remember Brooke. Not half a bad fellow. Lent me ten
pounds once, and never asked for it again. So it's <i>Brooke's</i>
daughter you&mdash; hm&mdash;live with. Sort of companion, you
are, eh, Mary?"</p>

<p>"Maid," said Mary, stolidly. "Ladies' maid. And
Miss Lesley's the sweetest young lady I ever come
across."</p>

<p>Francis shrugged his shoulders. "Your employment is
causing you to relapse into the manner&mdash;and grammar&mdash;of
your original station, Mary. May I suggest 'came' instead
of 'come'?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Trent looked at him with a still disdain.
"Suggest what you like," she said, "and think what you
like of me. I never took myself to be your equal in education
and all that. I may be your equal in sense and<a name="Page_152"></a>
heart and morals; but of course that goes for nothing with
such as you."</p>

<p>"Don't be savage, Mary," said Francis, in a conciliatory
tone. "I only want you to improve yourself a little, when
you can. You're the best woman in the world&mdash;nobody
knows it better than I do&mdash;and you should not take offense
at a trifle. So you like Brooke's daughter, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I like her. But I don't like your brother Oliver."</p>

<p>"I know that. What is he doing at Brooke's house?
Let me see&mdash;he isn't engaged to <i>that</i> girl? It's the actress
he's going to marry, isn't it?"</p>

<p>He had finished his meal by this time, and was smoking
one of the cigars that his wife had brought him. She,
meanwhile, turned up her sleeves, and made ready to wash
the cups and plates.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it," said Francis, who was now in
high good humor. "It sounds quite like the beginning of
a romance."</p>

<p>"There's no romance about it that I can see," said Mrs.
Trent, grimly. "Your brother is engaged to Miss Kenyon&mdash;a
nice, pretty young lady: rich, too, I hear."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! As you and I are going to find out by
and by, old lady," and he chuckled to himself at the
thought of his prospective wealth.</p>

<p>"And he ought to be content with that. Instead of
which, he's never out of our place; and when he's there
he never seems to take his eyes off Miss Lesley. Playing
the piano while she sings, reading to her, whispering, sitting
into her pocket, so to speak. I can't think what he's
about, nor other people neither."</p>

<p>"What does Miss Kenyon say?" asked Francis, with
sudden sharpness. For it occurred to him that if that
match were broken off he would not get his two thousand
pounds on Oliver's wedding-day.</p>

<p>"She doesn't seem to notice much. Once or twice lately
I've seen her look at them in a thoughtful, puzzled kind of
way, as if something had set her thinking. She looks at
Miss Lesley as if she could not quite make her out&mdash;though
the two have been friends ever since Miss Lesley came
home from school."</p>

<p>"And the girl herself?" said Francis, with considerable
and increasing interest. "What does she do?"<a name="Page_153"></a></p>

<p>"She looks troubled and puzzled, but I don't think she
understands. She's as innocent as a baby," said Mrs.
Trent, with compassion in her tone.</p>

<p>"I wonder what he's doing it for," soliloquized Francis.
"He can't marry her."</p>

<p>Mary Trent paused for a moment in her housewifely
occupations. "Why <i>can</i> he not?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;&mdash;well, I may as well tell you as not I've
never mentioned it&mdash;I don't know why exactly&mdash;but I'll
tell you now, Mary. A few weeks ago, when we were so
down on our luck, you know&mdash;just before you began to
work again&mdash;I met Oliver in Russell Square, and told him
what I wanted and what I thought of him. I brought him
to terms, I can tell you! He had just got himself engaged
to Miss Kenyon; and she has twenty thousand
pounds besides her profession; and he promised me two
thousand down on his wedding-day. What do you say to
that? And within six months, too! And if he doesn't
keep his word, I shall not hold my tongue about the one
or two little secrets of his that I possess&mdash;do you see?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Mrs. Trent, slowly, "he thinks he could
manage to pay you the money even if he married Miss
Brooke? So long as you get the two thousand, I suppose
you don't mind which girl it is?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," answered her husband frankly. "All I
want is the money. Then we'll go off to America, old girl,
and have the farm you talk about. But Brooke's daughter
won't have two thousand pounds, so if he marries her
instead of Miss Kenyon, he'll have to look out."</p>

<p>Mrs. Trent had finished her work by this time. As she
stood by the table drying her hands there was a look of
fixed determination on her features which Francis recognized
with some uneasiness.</p>

<p>"What do you think about it? What are you going to
do?" he asked, almost timidly.</p>

<p>"I am not going to see Miss Lesley badly treated, at any
rate."</p>

<p>"How can you prevent it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I <i>shall</i> prevent it, please God, if
necessary. Your brother Oliver is engaged to one girl, and
making love to another, that's the plain English of it; and
sooner than see him break Miss Lesley's heart, I'd up and
tell everybody what I know of him, and get him turned
out of the house."<a name="Page_154"></a></p>

<p>"And spoil my game?" cried Francis, rising to his feet.
His faced had turned white with anger, and his eyes were
aflame. She looked at him consideringly, as if she were
measuring his strength against her own.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;no," she said at length, "I won't spoil your
game if I can help it&mdash;and I think I can get my own way
without doing that. I want you to win your game, Francis.
For you know"&mdash;with a weary smile&mdash;"that if you
win, I win too."</p>

<p><a name="tn_159"></a><!--TN: Quote removed before "Her"-->Her husband's face relaxed. "You're not a bad sort,
Polly: I always said so," he remarked. "Come and give
me a kiss. You wouldn't do anything rash, would you?
Choke Oliver off at Brooke's as much as you like; but
don't endanger his relations with Ethel Kenyon. His
marriage with her is our only chance of getting out of this
accursed bog we seem to have stuck fast in."</p>

<p>"I'll be careful," said Mrs. Trent, drily.</p>

<p>Francis still eyed her with apprehension. "You won't
try to stop that marriage, will you?"</p>

<p>"No, why should I? Miss Kenyon's nothing to me."</p>

<p>Francis laughed. "I didn't know where your sympathies
might be carrying you," he said. "Brooke's daughter
is no more to you than the other girl."</p>

<p>"I suppose not. But I feel different to her. You can't
explain these things," said Mrs. Trent, philosophically,
"but it's certain sure that you take a liking to one person
and a hate to another, without knowing why. I liked Miss
Lesley ever since I entered that house. She's kind, and
talks to me as if I was a woman&mdash;not a machine. And I
wouldn't like to see any harm happen to her."</p>

<p>"Oh, you may indulge your romantic fondness for Miss
Brooke as long as you like, if you don't let it interfere with
Oliver's marriage," said Francis, with a rather disagreeable
laugh. "It's lucky that you did not go to live with Miss
Kenyon instead of the fair Lesley. You might have felt
tempted to tell <i>her</i> your little story."</p>

<p>"Ay, so I might," said the woman, slowly. "For she's
a woman, after all. And a nice life she'll have of it with
Oliver Trent. I'm not sure&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped, and a sombre light came into her deep-set
eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, for goodness' sake, don't get on that old grievance,"
said Francis, hastily, almost rudely. "Don't think<a name="Page_155"></a>
about it&mdash;don't mention it to me. It's all very well, Polly,
for you to take on so much about your sister; and, indeed,
I'm very sorry for her, and I think that Oliver behaved
abominably&mdash;I do, indeed; but, my dear girl, it's no good
crying over spilt milk, and Oliver's my brother, after
all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And he's going to pay you two thousand pounds on
his wedding-day," said Mrs. Trent, with cruel curtness. "I
know all about it. And I understand. Why should I be
above making my profit out of him like other people? All
right, Francis: I won't spoil your little game at present.
And now I must be getting back."</p>

<p>She took up her bonnet and shawl and began to readjust
them. Francis watched her hands: he saw that they trembled,
and he knew that this was an ominous sign. It sometimes
betokened anger, and when she was angry he did
not care to ask her to give him money. And he wanted
money now.</p>

<p>But she was not angry in the way that he thought. For
after a moment's silence her hands grew steady again, and
her face recovered its usual calm.</p>

<p>"I've got three pounds here for you, Francis," she said.
"And I hope you'll make it last as long as you can&mdash;you
will, won't you? For I shan't have any more for some
little time to come."</p>

<p>He nodded and took the sovereigns from her hand. A
touch of compunction visited him as he did so.</p>

<p>"Keep one, Polly," he said. "I don't want them all."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you do. And I have no need of money where
I am. You'll not spend it all at billiards, or on brandy,
will you?"</p>

<p>"No, Polly, I won't. I promise you."</p>

<p>And he meant to keep his promise. But as matters fell
out, he was blindly, madly drunk before the same night
was out, and he had lost every penny that he possessed
over a game at cards. And plunging recklessly across the
street, in the darkness of the foggy night, he was knocked
down by passing cab, and was carried insensible to the
nearest hospital. Where let us leave him for a time in
good and kindly hands.<a name="Page_156"></a></p>

<p class="chapterhead">"HER EYES WILL SEND ME MAD."</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">It</span> was true, as Mrs. Trent had said, that Lesley's face often
now wore a look of perplexity and trouble. This look had
many differing causes; but amongst them, not the least
was the behavior of Oliver Trent.</p>

<p>Oliver was betrothed to her friend, and she had so much
faith in the honor and constancy of men, that it never
occurred to her that he could prefer herself to Ethel, or
that he should think of behaving as though Ethel were not
the first person in the world to him. But as a matter of
fact, he did not conduct himself to Ethel at all as a lover
should have done. Assured of her love, he neglected her:
he failed to appear at the Theatre in time to escort her
home, he forgot his promises to visit her; he let her notes
lie unanswered in his pocket. And when she pouted and
remonstrated, he frowned her into silence, which was not
at all the way in which her lover ought to behave.</p>

<p>Of course Lesley did not know this, for Ethel had not
taken her into her confidence on the subject. But she
knew very well where Oliver spent his time. Early and
late, on small excuse or on no excuse at all, he presented
himself at Mr. Brooke's house, and made himself Lesley's
companion. At first Lesley did not dislike it. She supposed
that Ethel must be busy with her theatrical studies,
or at rehearsal, and that Oliver was in want of something
to do. It was pleasant to have the companionship of some
one younger and more congenial, perhaps, than her father
or Miss Brooke; and she gained a great deal of interesting
information from Oliver during the long hours that he
spent with her in the drawing-room or library. He told
her a great deal about London society, about modern
literature, and the fashions of the day; and all this was as
fascinating to Lesley as it was novel. He talked to her
about plays and music and pictures; and he read poetry<a name="Page_157"></a>
to her. Modern poetry, of course: a little Browning, and
a good deal of Rossetti and Swinburne. For amorous and
passionate poetry pleased him best; and he knew that it
was likelier to serve his ends than verse of the more masculine
and intellectual kind. Lesley rather preferred Browning
and Arnold to Oliver's favorites, but she was never
certain of her own taste, and was always humbly afraid
that she might be making some terrible mistake in her
preferences.</p>

<p>She certainly found Mr. Trent's aid very valuable in the
matter of her singing. The best singing-mistress in London
had been found for her, and she practised diligently every
day; but it was delightful to find somebody who could
always play her accompaniments, and was ready with discriminating
praise or almost more flattering criticism.
Oliver had considerable musical knowledge, and he placed
it at Lesley's service. She made a much quicker and more
marked advance in her singing than she could possibly have
done without his assistance. And for this she was grateful.</p>

<p>At the same time she was uneasy. It was contrary to
all her previous experience that a young man should be
allowed to spend so much time with her. She did not think
that her mother would approve of it. But she could not
ask Lady Alice, because she had now no communication
with her: a purely formal letter respecting her health and
general welfare was all, she had been told, that she would
be permitted to write. And sooner than write a letter of
that kind Lesley had proudly resolved not to write at all.
But she pined for womanly counsel and assistance in the
matter.</p>

<p>Miss Brooke was certainly not proving herself an efficient
chaperon. Aunt Sophy had never risen to a clear
view of her duty in the matter. She herself had never been
chaperoned in her life; but had gone about to lectures and
dissecting rooms and hospitals with a fine indifference to
sex. But then Doctor Sophy had never been a pretty
woman; and no young man had shown a wish to spend his
spare hours in her drawing-room. She had a strong belief
in the wisdom and goodness of women&mdash;young and old&mdash;and
declared that they could always take care of themselves
when they chose. And nothing would induce her to believe
that her niece, Lesley Brooke, required protection or guar<a name="Page_158"></a>dianship.
She would have thought it an insult to her own
family to suggest such a thing.</p>

<p>So she treated Lesley's rather timidly worded suggestions
on the subject with cheerful contempt, as the conventional
notions of a convent-bred young woman who had not yet
realized the strides made in the progress of mankind&mdash;and
especially of womankind. And Lesley soon felt quite sure
that any complaint or protest of hers would be dealt with
simply as a sign of weak-mindedness&mdash;a stigma which she
could not endure. So she said nothing, and submitted to
Oliver Trent's frequent visits with resignation.</p>

<p>It must be said, however, that Aunt Sophy had not the
least notion of the frequency of Oliver's visits. She was a
busy woman, and a somewhat absent-minded one; and Mr.
Trent often contrived to call when she was out or engaged.
And when she asked, as she sometimes did ask of Sarah&mdash;"Any
one called to-day?"&mdash;and received the grim answer
"Only Mr. Trent, as usual"&mdash;she simply laughed at
Sarah's sour visage, and did not calculate the number of
these visits in the week. Mr. Brooke himself grew uncomfortable
about the matter, sooner than did Miss Brooke.</p>

<p>"Sophy," he said, one day, when he happened to find
her alone in the library, sitting at the very top of the library
steps, with an immense volume of German science on her
knees. "Sophy, have you noticed that young Trent has
taken to coming here very often of late?"</p>

<p>"No," said Doctor Sophy, absently, "I haven't noticed."
Then she went on reading.</p>

<p>"My dear Sophy," said her brother, "will you do me
the kindness to listen to me for a moment?"</p>

<p>"Why, Caspar, I <i>am</i> listening as hard as I can!" exclaimed
Miss Brooke, with an injured air. "What do you
want?"</p>

<p>"I wish to speak about Lesley."</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought it was Mr. Trent."</p>

<p>"Does it not strike you that he comes here to see Lesley
a great deal too often?"</p>

<p>"Rubbish," cried Miss Brooke, pushing up her eyeglasses.
"Why, he's engaged to Ethel Kenyon."</p>

<p>"For all that," said Mr. Brooke, and then he paused
for a moment. "Did it never strike <i>you</i> that he was here
very often?"<a name="Page_159"></a></p>

<p>"No," said Aunt Sophy, stolidly. "Haven't noticed. I
suppose he comes to help Lesley with her singing. Good
gracious, Caspar, the girl can take care of herself."</p>

<p>"I dare say she can, but I don't want any trifling&mdash;or&mdash;or
flirtation&mdash;to go on," said Brooke, rather sharply. "We
are responsible for her, you know: we have to hand her
over in good condition, mind and body, at the end of the
twelve months. And if you can't look after her, I must get
her a companion or something. I've been inclined to come
up and play sheep-dog myself, sometimes, when I have
heard them practising for an hour together just above my
head."</p>

<p>"If they disturb you, Caspar," began Miss Brooke, with
real solicitude; but her brother did not allow her to finish
her sentence.</p>

<p>"No, no, they don't disturb me&mdash;in the way you mean.
I confess I should feel more comfortable if I thought that
somebody was with the two young people, to play propriety,
and all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"I thought you were above such conventionalism," said
Miss Brooke, glaring at him through her glasses from her
lofty height upon the steps.</p>

<p>"Not at all. Not where my daughter is concerned.
Children teach their father very new and unexpected lessons,
I find; and I don't look with equanimity on the prospect
of Lesley's being made love to by Oliver Trent, or of
her going back to her mother and telling her that she was
left so much to her own devices. I am sure of one thing&mdash;that
Lady Alice would not like it."</p>

<p>"And am I to give up all my engagements for the sake
of sitting with two silly young people?" said Miss Brooke,
the very hair of her head seeming to bristle with horror at
the idea.</p>

<p>"By no means. I don't see that you need be always
there; but be there sometimes; don't give occasion to the
enemy," said Mr. Brooke; turning to go.</p>

<p>"Who is the enemy?" said Doctor Sophy&mdash;a spiteful
question, as she well knew.</p>

<p>"The world," said Caspar Brooke, quite quietly: he did
not choose to see the spitefulness.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Miss Brooke. "I thought you meant your
wife." But she did not dare to say this until he was well
out of the room, and the door firmly closed behind him.<a name="Page_160"></a></p>

<p>But Miss Brooke was neither malicious nor unreasonable.
On consideration she came to the conclusion that her
brother was substantially right&mdash;as a matter of fact she
always came to that conclusion&mdash;and prepared to carry out
his views of the matter. Only she carried them out in her
own way. She made a point of being present on the occasion
of Mr. Trent's next two calls, and although she read
a book all the time, she was virtuously conscious of the
fact that her mere presence "made all the difference."
But on the third occasion she wanted to go out. What was
to be done? Miss Brooke's mind was fertile of resource,
and she triumphantly surmounted the difficulty.</p>

<p>"Kingston," she said to Lesley's maid, "I am obliged
to go out, and I don't like leaving Miss Lesley so much
alone. You may take your work down to the library and
sit there, and don't go away if visitors come in. You can
just draw the curtains, you know."</p>

<p>"Am I to stay all the afternoon, ma'am?" Kingston
inquired, with surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes. I'll speak to Miss Lesley about it. I think she
ought to have some one at hand when I am out so much."
So Kingston&mdash;<i>alias</i> Mary Trent&mdash;took her needlework,
and seated herself by the library window, whence the half-drawn
curtains between library and drawing-room afforded
her a complete view of all visitors to Miss Lesley.</p>

<p>Oliver Trent was distinctly annoyed by this proceeding,
but Lesley, although puzzled, was equally well pleased. It
was an arrangement all the more displeasing to Oliver
because the waiting-woman who sat so demurely in the
library, within earshot of all that he chose to say, was his
brother's wife. He felt sure that she had contrived it all;
that she was there simply to act as a spy upon his actions.
Francis wanted that money, and would not get it until he
married Miss Kenyon; and was evidently afraid&mdash;from information
conveyed to him by Kingston&mdash;that he was
going to break off his engagement. Oliver flew into a silent
rage at the thought of this combination, which he was nevertheless
powerless to prevent. He went away early that
afternoon, and came again next day. Kingston was there
also with her work. And though he sang and played the
piano as usual with Lesley, although he chatted and laughed
and had tea with her as usual, he felt Kingston's presence a
restraint And for the first time he asked himself, seriously,
why this should be.<a name="Page_161"></a></p>

<p>"Why, of course," he said to himself, "I promised Rosalind
to make love to her. And I can't make love to her
when that woman's there. Curse her! she spoils my plans."</p>

<p>He had shut himself up in the luxurious little smoking-room
which Mrs. Romaine had arranged for him. She knew
the value of a room in which a man feels himself at liberty
to do what he likes. She never came there without especial
invitation: she always said that she preferred seeing her
brother in her own drawing-room&mdash;that she was not like
Miss Brooke, and did <i>not</i> smoke cigarettes. But that was
one of the little ways in which Rosalind used to emphasize
the difference between herself and the women whom she
did not love.</p>

<p>At any rate, Oliver was alone. The curtains were drawn,
the lamp was lighted, a bright fire burned in the grate. He
had drawn up a softly-cushioned lounging chair to the fire,
and was peacefully smoking a remarkably good cigar.</p>

<p>But his frame of mind was anything but peaceful. He
had been troubled for some days, and he did not know what
troubled him. He was now beginning to find out.</p>

<p>"What are my plans, I wonder?" he reflected. "To
make Lesley fall in love with me?&mdash;I wish I could! She is
as cold as ice; as innocent as a child: and yet I think
there is a tremendous capacity for passion in those dark
eyes of hers, those mobile, sensitive lips! What lips to kiss!
what eyes to flash back fire and feeling! what a splendid
woman to win and show the world! It would be like loving
a goddess&mdash;as if Diana herself had stooped from Olympus
to grace Endymion!"</p>

<p>And then he laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"What a fool I am! Poetizing like a boy; and all about
a girl who never can be my wife at all. That's the worst
part of it. I am engaged&mdash;engaged! unutterably ridiculous
word!&mdash;to marry little Ethel Kenyon, the pretty actress
at the Novelty. The respectable, wealthy, well-connected
actress, moreover&mdash;the product of modern civilization: the
young woman of our day who aspires to purify the drama
and vindicate the claims of histrionic art&mdash;what rubbish it
all is! If Ethel were a ballet-dancer, or had taken to opera
bouffe, she would be much more entertaining! But her enthusiasms,
and her belief in herself and her mission, along
with that <i>mignonne</i>, provoking, pretty, little face of hers,
are altogether too incongruous! No, Ethel bores me, it<a name="Page_162"></a>
must be confessed; and I have got to marry her&mdash;all for a
paltry twenty thousand pounds! What a fool I was to
propose before I had seen Brooke's daughter.</p>

<p>"If it weren't for Francis, I would break it off. But
how else am I to pay that two thousand? And what won't
he do if I fail to pay it? No, that would be ruin&mdash;unless
I choke him off in some other way, and I don't see how I
can do that. No, I must marry Ethel, I suppose, or go to
the devil. And unless I could take bonny Lesley with me,
that would not mend matters."</p>

<p>He threw his cigar into the fire, and stood for some
minutes looking down at it, with gloom imprinted upon his
brow.</p>

<p>"I must do something," he said at last. "It's getting
too much for me: I shall have to stop going to Brooke's
house. I suppose this is what people call falling in love!
Well, I can honestly say I have never done it in this
fashion before! I have flirted, I have made love scores of
times, but I never wanted a woman for my own as I want
<i>her</i>! And I think I had better keep out of her way&mdash;for
her eyes will send me mad!"</p>

<p>So he soliloquized: so he resolved; but inclination was
stronger than will or judgment. Day after day saw him at
the Brookes' house; and day after day saw the shadows
deepen on Ethel's face, and the fold of perplexity grow more
distinct between Lesley's tender brows.</p>

<p>Kingston had been looking ill and uneasy for some days
past, and one afternoon she begged leave to go out for an
hour or two to see a friend. Miss Brooke let her go, and
went out to a meeting with a perfectly contented mind.
Even if Oliver Trent came to the house that afternoon it
would not matter: it would be only "once in a way." And
Lesley secretly hoped that he would not come.</p>

<p>But he came. A little later than usual&mdash;about four
o'clock in the afternoon, when there was no light in the
drawing-room but that of the ruddy blaze, and the tea-tray
had not yet been brought up. When Lesley saw him she
wished that she had sent down word that she was engaged,
that she had a headache, or even that she was&mdash;conventionally&mdash;not
at home. Anything rather than a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te
with Oliver Trent! And yet she would have been puzzled
to say why.<a name="Page_163"></a></p>

<p>His quick eye told him almost at once that she was alone.
It told him also that she was decidedly nervous and ill-at-ease.</p>

<p>"We must have lights," she said. "Then you can see
my new song. I had a fresh one this morning."</p>

<p>"Never mind the lights: never mind your song," he
said, his voice vibrating strangely. "If you are like me,
you love this delightful twilight."</p>

<p>"I don't like it," said Lesley, with decision. "I will ring
for the lamps, please."</p>

<p>She moved a step, but by a dexterous movement he
interposed himself between her and the mantelpiece, beside
which hung the bell-handle.</p>

<p>"Shall I ring?" he asked, coolly. It seemed to him
that he wanted to gain time. And yet&mdash;time for what?
He had nothing to get by gaining time.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you please," Lesley said. She could not get
past him without seeming rude. A slight tremor shook her
frame; she shrank away from him, towards the open piano
and leaned against it as if for support. The flickering firelight
showed her that his face was very pale, the lips were
tightly closed, the brows knitted above his fiercely flaming
eye. He did not look like himself.</p>

<p>"Lesley," he said, hoarsely, and stretching forward, he
put one hand upon her arm. But the touch gave the girl
strength. She drew her arm away, as sharply as if a
noxious animal had touched her.</p>

<p>"Mr. Trent, you forget yourself."</p>

<p>"Rather say that I remember myself&mdash;that I found myself
when I found you! Lesley, I love you!"</p>

<p>"This is shameful&mdash;intolerable! You are pledged to my
friend&mdash;you have said all this to her before," cried Lesley,
in bitter wrath and indignation.</p>

<p>"I have said it, but I never knew the meaning of love
till I knew you. Lesley, you love me in return! Let us
leave the world together&mdash;you and I. Nothing can give me
the happiness that your love would bring. Lesley, Lesley,
my darling!"</p>

<p>He threw his arm round her, and tried to kiss her cold
cheek, her averted, half-open lips. She would have pushed
him from her if she had had the strength; but it seemed
as if her strength was failing her. Suddenly, with a half-smothered
oath, he let her go&mdash;so suddenly, indeed, that<a name="Page_164"></a>
she almost fell against the piano near which she had been
standing. For the door had opened, and the tall figure of
Caspar Brooke stood on the threshold of the room.<a name="Page_165"></a></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">MAURICE KENYON'S VIEWS.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Mr. Brooke</span> advanced quite <a name="tn_170"></a><!-- TN: "quitely" changed to "quietly"-->quietly into the room. Perhaps
he had not seen or heard so very much. Certainly
he glanced very keenly&mdash;first at Lesley, who leaned half-fainting
against the piano, and then at Oliver Trent, who
had slunk backwards to the rug before the fire; but he
said nothing, and for a minute or two an embarrassed
silence prevailed in the room. Lesley then raised herself
up a little, and Oliver began to speak.</p>

<p>"I was just going," he said, with a nervous attempt at a
laugh. "I haven't much time to-night, and was just hurrying
away. I must come in another time."</p>

<p>Mr. Brooke took up a commanding position on the rug,
put his hands in his pockets, and surveyed the room in
silence. Perhaps Oliver felt the silence to be ominous, for
he did not try to shake hands or to utter any commonplaces,
but took his leave with a hurried "Good-afternoon"
that neither father nor daughter returned. The door shut
behind him: they heard the sound of his footsteps on the
stairs and the closing of the hall door. Then Lesley bestirred
herself with the sensation of a wounded animal that wishes
to hide its hurt: she wanted to get away and seek the darkness
and solitude of her room upstairs. But before she
reached the door Mr. Brooke's voice arrested her.</p>

<p>"Lesley."</p>

<p>She stopped short, and looked at him. Her heart beat
so suffocatingly loud and fast that she could not speak.</p>

<p>"I don't trust that young man, Lesley," was what her
father said quite quietly.</p>

<p>Then there was a pause. Lesley was still tongue-tied,
and Mr. Brooke did not seem to know what to do or say.
He walked away from the fire and began to finger some
papers on a table, although it was quite too dark to see
any of these. Inwardly he was wondering how much or
how little he ought to say.<a name="Page_166"></a></p>

<p>"I wish he would not come quite so often," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh, so do I!" said Lesley, with heartfelt warmth.</p>

<p>"Do you? Why, child, I thought you liked him!"</p>

<p>"I never liked him much," said Lesley, faltering.</p>

<p>"And yet you have allowed him to come here day after
day and practise with you? The ways of women are inscrutable,"
said Mr. Brooke, grimly, "and I can't profess
to understand them. If you did not wish him to come,
there was nothing to do but to close your doors against
him."</p>

<p>"I shall be only too glad," said Lesley, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;<i>now</i>? That is unnecessary: I shall do it myself,"
said her father, with the same dryness of tone that always
made Lesley feel as if she were withering up to nothingness.</p>

<p>"I don't think he is very likely to come," she said, in a
very low tone. Then, with a quick impulse to clear herself,
and an effort which brought the blood in a burning
tide to her fair face, she went on, hurriedly&mdash;"Father, you
don't think I forgot that he"&mdash;and then she almost broke
down, and "Ethel" was the only word that struck distinctly
upon his ear.</p>

<p>"You mean," said Mr. Brooke, "that you do not forget
that he is going to marry Ethel Kenyon? Perhaps not;
but I <a name="tn_171"></a><!-- TN: "thing" changed to "think"-->think that <i>he</i> does."</p>

<p>"I am not to blame for that," said Lesley, with a flash
of the hot temper that occasionally leaped to light when she
was talking with her father.</p>

<p>Brooke made no immediate answer. He took a match
box from his pocket, struck a match, and began to light
the wax candles on the mantelpiece&mdash;partly by way of finding
something to do, partly because he thought that he
should like to see his daughter's face.</p>

<p>It was a very downcast face just then, but it was tinged
with the hot flush of mingled pride and shame with which
she had spoken, and never had it looked more lovely. The
father considered it for a moment, less with admiration
than with curiosity: this daughter of his was an unknown
quantity: he never could predicate what she would do or
say. Certainly she surprised him once more when she
lifted her head, and said, quickly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't think I understand your English ways. I know
what we should do at the convent; but I never know whe<a name="Page_167"></a>ther
I am right or wrong here. And I have no one to
ask."</p>

<p>"There is your Aunt Sophy."</p>

<p>"It is almost impossible to ask Aunt Sophy; she never
sees where the difficulty lies. I know she is kind&mdash;but she
does not understand what I want."</p>

<p>Caspar nodded. "That is one reason why I spoke to
you just now," he said, much more gently than usual. "I
knew that she was a little brusque sometimes; and I suppose
I am not much better. As a rule a father does not
talk to his girls as I have been talking to you, I fancy.
I am almost as ignorant of a father's duties to his daughter
as you say you are of the habits of English bourgeois
society&mdash;for I suppose that is what you mean?"</p>

<p>He smiled a little&mdash;the slight smile of a satire which Lesley
always dreaded; and yet, she remembered, his voice
had been very kind. It softened again into its gentlest
and most musical tones, as he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must take us as you find us, child: we shall not
do you much harm, and it will not be for long."</p>

<p>Lesley was emboldened by the gentle intonation to draw
closer to him, and to lay an entreating hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, father," she said, "if you would but let me write to
mamma!"</p>

<p>And then she uttered a little sob, and the tears filled her
eyes and ran down her cheeks. As for Caspar Brooke, he
stood like a man amazed, and repeated her words almost
stupidly.</p>

<p>"<i>Write to mamma?</i>" he said.</p>

<p>"It would do me good: it would not do any harm," said
Lesley, hurriedly, brokenly, and clasping his arm with both
hands to enforce her plea. "I would not tell her anything
that you did not like: I should never say anything but
good about you; but, oh, there are so many things that
puzzle me, and that I should like to consult her about. You
see, although I was not much with her, I used to write to
her twice a week, and she wrote to me oftener, sometimes;
and I told her everything, and she used to advise me and
help me! And I miss it so much&mdash;it is that that makes me
unhappy; it seems so hard never to write and never to hear
from her! I feel sometimes as if I could not bear it; as if
I should have to run away to her again and tell her everything!
Nobody is like her&mdash;nobody&mdash;and to be a year
without her is terrible!"<a name="Page_168"></a></p>

<p>And Lesley put her head down on her father's arm and
cried unrestrainedly, with a sort of newborn instinct that
he sympathised with her, and would not repulse her confidence.</p>

<p>As for Caspar Brooke, his face had turned quite pale: he
stood like a statue, with features rigidly set, listening to
Lesley's outburst of pleading words. It took him a little
time to find his voice, even when he had at last assimilated
the ideas contained in her speech and regained his self-possession.
It took him still longer to recover from a
certain shock of surprise.</p>

<p>"Write to your mother!" he exclaimed. "Well, but,
of course&mdash;why should you not write to your mother?"</p>

<p>And then Lesley raised her head and looked at him with
such amazement and perplexity that her father felt absolutely
annoyed.</p>

<p>"Who on earth put it into your head that you might
not write? Am I such a tyrant&mdash;such an unfeeling monster&mdash;&mdash;? Good
heavens! what extraordinary idea is this!
Who said that you were not to write to her?"</p>

<p>"My mother herself," said Lesley, drawing herself a little
away from him, and still looking into his face.</p>

<p>"Your <i>mother</i>? Absurd! Why, what&mdash;what&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He faltered, frowned, turned away to the mantelpiece,
and struck his hand heavily upon it.</p>

<p>"I never meant <i>that</i>," he said. It seemed as if vexation
and astonishment prevented him from saying more.</p>

<p>"My mother said that it was agreed&mdash;years ago&mdash;that
when I came to you, we were to have no communication,"
said Lesley, trembling, and yet resolute to have her say.
"Was not that so?"</p>

<p>"I remember something of the sort," he answered,
reluctantly, frowning still and looking down. "I did not
think at the time of what it implied. And when the time
drew near for you to make the visit, the question was not
raised. We corresponded through a third party&mdash;the
lawyer, you know. Perhaps&mdash;at the time&mdash;I had an idea
of preventing letters, but not recently. Nobody mentioned
it. Why"&mdash;his anger rising, as a man's anger often does
rise when he perceives himself to have been in the wrong&mdash;"your
mother might at least have mentioned it if she
felt any doubt!"</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Lesley, rather haughtily, "that my
mother did not want to ask a favor of you."<a name="Page_169"></a></p>

<p>He flung himself round at that. "Your mother must
have given you a strange idea of me!" he said, with a
mixture of anger and mortification which it humiliated him
to show, even while he could not manage to hide it. "One
would have said I was an ogre&mdash;a maniac. But she misjudged
me all her life&mdash;it is useless to expect anything else&mdash;of
course she would try to bias you!"</p>

<p>"I never knew that you were even alive until the day
that I left the convent," said Lesley. "My mother certainly
did not try to prejudice me before then: she simply
kept silence."</p>

<p>"Silence is the worst condemnation? What had I done
that I should be separated from my child so completely?"
said the man, the bitterness of years displaying itself in a
way as unexpected to him as to his daughter. "It is not
my fault, I swear, that I have lived without a wife, without&mdash;well,
well! it is not you to whom I ought to say this.
We will not refer to it again. About this letter writing&mdash;I
might say, as perhaps I did say at the time the arrangement
was made, that surely I had a right to claim you
entirely for one year at least; but I don't&mdash;I won't. If I
did ever say so, Lesley, I regret the words exceedingly.
Ever since you came to me, I have had no idea but that
you were writing to her regularly and freely; and I never&mdash;never
in my right mind&mdash;wished it otherwise."</p>

<p>"But mamma talked of an agreement&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was years ago. I must have said something in
my heat which the lawyers&mdash;the people who arranged
things&mdash;interpreted wrongly. And your mother, as you
say, did not care to ask me for anything. I can only say,
Lesley, that I am sorry the mistake arose."</p>

<p>His voice was grave and cold again, almost indifferent.
He stood with his elbow on the mantelpiece, his hand supporting
his head, his eyes averted from the girl. A close
eye might have observed that the veins of his forehead were
swollen, and the pulse at his temple was beating furiously:
otherwise he had mastered all signs of agitation. Lesley
hesitated a moment: then came up to him, and put her
slim fingers into his hand.</p>

<p>"Father," she said, softly, "if we <i>have</i> misjudged you&mdash;mamma
and I&mdash;won't you forgive us?"</p>

<p>For answer he took her face between his two hands,
bent down and kissed it tenderly.<a name="Page_170"></a></p>

<p>"You don't remember sitting on my knee when you
were a tiny little thing, do you?" he asked her. "You
would not go to sleep at nights without a kiss from me
before I went out. You were rather fond of me then,
child! I wish things had turned out differently!"</p>

<p>He spoke sadly, and Lesley returned his kiss with a new
feeling of affection of which she had not been conscious
before, but which she would have found it difficult to translate
into words. Before she could manage to reply, the
handle of the door was turned, and father and daughter
stood apart as quickly as if they had had no right to stand
with arms enlaced and faces almost touching: indeed, the
situation was so new to both of them that they felt something
like shame and alarm as they turned to meet the
expected Doctor Sophy.</p>

<p>But it was not Doctor Sophy. It was Sarah with the
tea-tray, very resentful at not having had it rung for earlier&mdash;she
having been instructed not to bring it up until Miss
Lesley rang the bell. And after Sarah came Mr. Maurice
Kenyon, unannounced, after his usual fashion. And on
hearing his voice, Lesley slipped away between the curtains
into the library, and upstairs, through the library door.</p>

<p>"Why, Brooke, old fellow, you're not often to be found
here at this hour!" began Maurice. He looked on Caspar
Brooke as a prophet and a hero in his heart; but his manner
before the world was characterized by the frankest
irreverence. Brooke was one of those men who are never
older than their companions.</p>

<p>"Well, you must be neglecting your patients shamefully
to be here at all. What do you want at this feminine
meal?"</p>

<p>"I didn't come for tea," said Maurice, actually growing
a little redder as he spoke. "I came to see Miss Brooke."</p>

<p>"Oh, she's gone to a meeting of some Medical Association
or other," said Caspar, indifferently, as he sat down
in Lesley's place at the dainty tea-table, and poured out a cup
of tea with the manner of a man who was accustomed to
serving himself. "Here, help yourself to sugar and cream."</p>

<p>"Thanks, I won't have any tea. I did not mean your
sister: I meant Miss Lesley&mdash;I thought I saw her as I
came in."</p>

<p>"Anything important?" said Caspar, blandly. He
was certain that Lesley had gone away to cry&mdash;women<a name="Page_171"></a>
always cry!&mdash;and he did not want her to be disturbed.
Although he had quarrelled with his wife, he understood
feminine susceptibilities better than most men.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Only to ask her to sing at the Club on Sunday.
It's my turn to manage the music for that day, you
know. Trent is going to sing too."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mr. Brooke. Then, after a pause: "I will
ask her. But I don't think she will be able to sing on Sunday.
It strikes me she has an engagement."</p>

<p>He could not say to Ethel's brother what was in his mind,
and yet he was troubled by the intensity of his conviction
that she was throwing herself away upon "a cad." He
must take some other method in the future of giving Maurice
a hint about young Trent.</p>

<p>Maurice thought, not untruly, that there was something
odd in his tone.</p>

<p>"Isn't she well?" he asked, with his usual straightforwardness.
"I hope there is nothing wrong."</p>

<p>"I did not say there was anything wrong, did I?"
demanded Caspar. Then, squaring his shoulders, and
sitting well back in his chair, with his hands plunged into
the pockets of his old study coat, and his eyes fixed on his
visitor's face, he thus acquitted himself&mdash;"Maurice, my
young friend, I am and have been a most confounded ass."</p>

<p>"Oh?" said Maurice, interrogatively.</p>

<p>"I think it would relieve me&mdash;if I weren't out of practice&mdash;to
swear. But I've preached against 'langwidge' so
long at the club that I don't think I could get up the necessary
stock of expletives."</p>

<p>"I'll supply you. I shouldn't have thought that there
was a lack of them down in your printing offices about one
or two o'clock every morning, from what I've heard. What
is it, if I may ask? Anything wrong with the Football
Club?"</p>

<p>"Football Club! My dear fellow, I have a private life,
unfortunately, as contradistinguished from your everlasting
clubs and printing offices."</p>

<p>"It is something about Miss Brooke, is it?" said
Maurice, with greater interest "I was afraid there was
something&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;well, you must excuse me for mentioning it&mdash;but
wasn't she&mdash;wasn't she crying as she went out of the room?<a name="Page_172"></a>
And she has not been looking well for the last month
or so."</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean that she is not particularly happy
here, with her father?"</p>

<p>Maurice elevated his eyebrows. "Brooke, old man, what
have you got into your head?" he asked, kindly. "You
look put out a good bit. Does she say she wants to leave
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, 'tisn't that. I daresay she does, though.
You know the whole story&mdash;it is no good disguising the
details from you. There's been a wretched little mistake&mdash;all
my fault, no doubt, but not intentionally so: the girl
came here with the idea that she might not write to her
mother&mdash;some nonsense about 'no communication' between
them stood in the way; and it seems she has been
pining to do so ever since she came."</p>

<p>"And she never asked you? never complained, or said
anything?"</p>

<p>"She broke down over it to-day. I'm ashamed to look
her in the face," said Brooke, vehemently. "I'm ashamed
to think of what they&mdash;their opinion of me is. A domineering,
flinty-hearted, unnatural parent, eh, Maurice? Ogre
and tyrant and all the rest of it. As if I ever meant to put
a stop to her writing to her mother! I never heard of such
an unjustifiable proceeding! I never thought of such an
absurd idea!"</p>

<p>"Then weren't you very much to blame to allow the
mistake to arise?" asked Maurice, bluntly.</p>

<p>"Of course I was. That's the abominable and confounded
part of it. Some hasty words of mine were misinterpreted,
of course. I told you I had been an ass."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope it is set straight now?"</p>

<p>"As far as I can set it straight. Probably nothing will
undo the effect. She'll think that I was cruel in the first
instance if not in the last."</p>

<p>He sat staring at his boots, with a very discontented
expression of countenance. But he did not get much
sympathy from Mr. Kenyon.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I suppose you've yourself to blame.
I've no doubt you have been very hasty, lots of times. It's
my own idea that if you went into detail over a good many
actions of your past life"&mdash;this was very significantly said&mdash;"you
would find that you had been mistaken pretty<a name="Page_173"></a>
often. We all do. And there's one mistake that I think
I can point out to you."</p>

<p>Caspar looked at him hard for a moment from under
his bushy eyebrows.</p>

<p>"One subject, Kenyon," he said, seriously, "I shall ask
you to respect."</p>

<p>"All right," said Maurice. "I am only speaking of
your daughter. You must allow me to say that I think
you have misjudged her, ever since she has been in your
house for the last three months. I did just the same, at
first. You see, she came here, as far as I can make out,
puzzled, ignorant of the world, deprived of her mother's
help and care, thrown on the tender mercies of a father
whom she did not know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And whom she took to be an ogre," said Brooke, with
a bitter, little laugh.</p>

<p>"Brought into a world that she knew nothing about, and
amongst a set of people who could not understand why
she looked sad and lonely, poor child!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say, Maurice, you are speaking of my daughter,
remember."</p>

<p>"Don't be touchy, old man. I speak and I think of
her with every respect. We have all misjudged and misunderstood
her: she is a young girl, little more than a
child, and a child astray, pining uncomplainingly for her
mother, doing her best to understand the new world she
was thrown into, devouring your writings and trying as
hard as she could to assimilate every good and noble idea
that she came across&mdash;I say that she's a saint and a
heroine," said Maurice, with sudden passion and enthusiasm,
"and we've forgotten that not a girl in a thousand
could have come through a trying ordeal so well!"</p>

<p>"She hasn't come out of her ordeal at all, Maurice: the
ordeal of living in the house of a brutal father, who, in her
view, probably broke her mother's heart: all that has to be
proceeded with for nine months longer!"</p>

<p>"It need not be an ordeal if she knows that you love her:
if she writes to her mother and gets the sympathy and aid
she needs. Upon my soul, Brooke, it seems to me that you
are hard upon your daughter!"</p>

<p>"Do you think I need to be taught my duty by you,
young man?" said Caspar. He spoke with a smile, but
his tone was undoubtedly sharp. His disciple was not so
submissive as he had hitherto appeared to be.<a name="Page_174"></a></p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said Maurice, undismayed. "Because I
appreciate her and understand her, which you don't. I was
dense at first as you are, but I have learnt better now&mdash;through
loving her."</p>

<p>"Through <i>what</i>, man?"</p>

<p>"Through loving her. It's the truth, Brooke, as I stand
here. I've known it for some little time. It is only because
it may seem too sudden to her and to you that I haven't
spoken before, and I did not mean to do so when I came
here this afternoon. But the fact remains, I love Lesley,
and I want her to be my wife."</p>

<p>"Heavens and earth!" said Caspar. "Is the man gone
mad!"<a name="Page_175"></a></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">LESLEY'S LETTER.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">"Not</span> a bit of it," said Maurice sturdily. "I speak the
words of truth and soberness. I've thought about it for
some time."</p>

<p>"A week?"</p>

<p>"I'm in earnest, Brooke. Do you consent?"</p>

<p>"My good man," said Caspar, slowly, "you forget that
I am probably the last person in the world whose consent
is of any value."</p>

<p>"Pooh!"</p>

<p>"You may say 'pooh' as much as you like, but the fact
remains. When Lesley leaves me, say next August or
September, she goes to her mother and her grandfather,
who's an earl, more's the pity. They have the guardianship,
you understand."</p>

<p>"But you have it legally still."</p>

<p>"Hum&mdash;no: we had a formal separation. I named the
terms, certainly: I was angry at the time, and was inclined
to say that if I might not bring up the child in my
own way, neither should its mother. That was why we
compromised by sending her to school&mdash;but it was to be
a school of Lady Alice's choice. The year with me afterwards
was a suggestion of mine, of course. But I can't
alter what was agreed on then."</p>

<p>"Naturally. But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And as to money affairs," said Caspar, ruthlessly cutting
him short, "I have been put all along into the most
painful and ridiculous position that a man can well be in.
I offered to settle a certain income on my wife and daughter:
Lady Alice and her father refused to accept any
money from me. I have paid various sums into his bank
for Lesley, but I have reason to believe that they have
never touched a farthing of it. You see they've put me at
a disadvantage all round. And what is to be done when
she marries, unless she marries with their consent, I don't<a name="Page_176"></a>
quite see. She won't like to offend them or seem ungrateful
when they have done so much for her; and I&mdash;according
to the account that they will give her&mdash;I have done
nothing. So I don't suppose I shall be consulted about
her marriage."</p>

<p>"You are her father: you must be consulted."</p>

<p>"Well, as a matter of form! But I expect that she is
destined to marry a duke, my dear fellow; and I call it
sheer folly on your part to have fallen in love with her."</p>

<p>"But you don't object, Brooke?"</p>

<p>"I only hope that the destined duke will be half as
decent a chap as you are. But I can't encourage you&mdash;Lesley
will have to look out for squalls if she engages herself
to you."</p>

<p>"May I not speak to her then?" inquired Maurice ruefully.
"Not at once, perhaps, you know; but if I think
that I have a chance?"</p>

<p>"Say what you like," said Brooke, with a genial smile;
for his ill-humor had vanished in spite of his apparent
opposition to Maurice's suit. "I should like nothing
better&mdash;for my own part; but we are both bound to consider
Lesley. You know you are a shocking bad match
for her. Oh, I know you are the descendant of kings and
all that sort of bosh, but as a matter of fact you are only a
young medico, a general practitioner, and his lordship is
bound to think that I am making something for myself out
of the marriage."</p>

<p>"You don't think he'll consent?"</p>

<p>"Never, my dear boy. One m&eacute;salliance was enough for
him. He has got rid of me, and regained his daughter;
but no doubt he intends to repair her mistake by a grand
match for Lesley."</p>

<p>"But perhaps she would not marry the man he chose
for her?"</p>

<p>Brooke laughed. "Can't answer for Lesley, I don't
know her well enough," he said. "Have you any notion,
now, that she cares for you?"</p>

<p>Maurice shook his head dismally. "Not in the least. I
scarcely think she even likes me. But I mean to try my
chance some day."</p>

<p>"I wish you joy," said Lesley's father, with a slight
enigmatical smile. "Especially with the Earl of Courtleroy.
Hallo! there's the dinner bell. We have wasted
all our time talking up here: you'll stay and dine?"<a name="Page_177"></a></p>

<p>"No, thanks&mdash;wish I could, but I must dine with Ethel,
and go out directly afterwards."</p>

<p>"When is the marriage to take place?" said Caspar,
directing a keen glance to the face of his friend.</p>

<p>"Ethel's? There is nothing settled."</p>

<p>"I say, Maurice, I don't like Trent. He's a slippery
customer. I would look after him a bit if I were you, and
put Ethel on her guard. I think I am bound to say as
much as that."</p>

<p>"Do you think any harm of him?"</p>

<p>"I <i>think</i> harm of him&mdash;unjustly, perhaps. I am not so
sure that I know of any. I only want you to keep your
eyes open. Good-bye, old man."</p>

<p>And Caspar Brooke gave his friend's hand such a pressure
that Maurice went away satisfied that Lesley's father,
at any rate, and in spite of protest, was upon his side.</p>

<p>Miss Brooke came into dinner at the last moment, so Mr.
Brooke and his daughter were saved the embarrassment of
dining alone&mdash;for it could not be denied that it would
have been embarrassing after the recent scene, if there had
been no third person present to whom they could address
remarks. Miss Brooke's mind was full of the meeting
which she had attended, and she gave them a glowing
account of it. Lesley spoke very little, but her face was
happier than it had been for a long time, although her eyes
were red. Mr. Brooke looked at her a good deal in a furtive
kind of way, and with more interest than usual. She
was certainly a good-looking girl. But that was not all.
Caspar Brooke had passed the period of caring for good
looks and nothing else. Lesley had spirit, intelligence,
honesty, endurance, as well as beauty. Well, she might
make a good wife for Maurice after all. For although he
had declared that Kenyon was "a shocking bad match,"
he was inclined to think in his own heart that Kenyon was
too good for his daughter Lesley.</p>

<p>However, he had a soft corner in his big heart for the
little girl who used to sit on his knee and refuse to go to
sleep without his good-night kiss, and he was pleased when
she came up to him before he went out that evening, and
timidly put her face up to be kissed, as if she had still been
the child he loved. She had never done that before; and
he took it more as a sign of gratitude for permission to
write to Lady Alice than actual affection for himself.<a name="Page_178"></a></p>

<p>"Are you writing your letter?" he said, touching her
cheek half playfully, half caressingly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lesley, looking down. "Is there&mdash;have
you&mdash;no message?"</p>

<p>"Why should I have a message? Your mother and I
correspond through our lawyer, my dear. But&mdash;well, yes,
if you like to say that I am sorry for this mistake of the last
few months, you may do so. I have no doubt that she
has missed your letters, and I should like her to understand
that the correspondence was not discontinued at my
desire. I regret the mistake."</p>

<p>He said it formally and gravely, and in a particularly
icy tone of voice; but Lesley was for the moment satisfied.
She went back to her writing-desk and took up her pen.
She had already written a couple of sheets, but in them
her father's name had scarcely been mentioned. Now,
however, she wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"You may be wondering, dearest mamma, why I am
writing to you in this way, because you told me that I
must not write, and I have put off my explanation until
almost the end. I could not bear to be without your
letters any longer, and to-day I said so to my father. I
could not help telling him, because I was so miserable.
And he wishes me to tell you that it was all a mistake, and
he is very sorry; he never meant to put a stop to our
writing to each other, and he is very, <i>very</i> sorry that we
thought so." Lesley's version was not so dignified as her
father had intended it to be. "He was terribly distressed
when he found out that I was not writing to you; and
called himself all sorts of names&mdash;a tyrant and an ogre,
and asked what we must have thought of him! He was
really very much grieved about it, and never meant us to
leave off writing. So now I shall write as often as I
please, and you, dearest mamma, will write to me too.</p>

<p>"There is one thing I must say, darling mother, and you
will not be angry with me for saying it, will you? I think
father must be different now from what he was in the old
days; or else&mdash;perhaps there <i>may</i> have been a mistake
about him, such as there has been about the letters! For
he is so clever and gentle and kind&mdash;a little sarcastic now
and then, but always good! The poor people at the Club
(which I told you about in the last sheet) just adore him;
and they say that he has saved many of them from worse<a name="Page_179"></a>
than death. And you never told me about his book, dear
mamma&mdash;'The Unexplored.' It is such a beautiful book&mdash;surely
you think so, although you think ill of the writer?
Of course you have read it? I have read it four times, I
think; and I want to ask him about some parts of it, but
I have never dared&mdash;I don't think he even knows that I
have read it. It has gone through more than twelve
editions, and has been translated into French and German,
so you <i>must</i> have seen it. And Mr. Kenyon says it sells
by thousands in America.</p>

<p>"It was Mr. Kenyon who first told me about it, and
made me understand how blind I was at first to my father's
really <i>great</i> qualities. I know he is not like grandpapa&mdash;he
does sometimes seem a little rough when compared to
grandpapa; but then you always said I must not expect
every man I met in the world to have grandpapa's courtly
manners. And it must have been very lonely for you if he
went out at such funny hours as he does now, and did not
breakfast or lunch with you! But I am told that all 'journalists
keep these hours,' and that it is very provincial of
me not to know it! It is a very different house, and different
life, from any that I ever saw before; but I am getting
accustomed to it now, especially since Mr. Kenyon
has talked to me.</p>

<p>"Dearest mother, don't think that I love you one whit
the less because I am away from you, and am learning to
love other people a little too. Nobody could be to me
what you are, my own dear mother.&mdash;Your child,</p>

<p class="signature">"<span class="smcap">Lesley.</span>"</p></div>

<p>So Lesley's girlish, emotional, indiscreet letter went
upon its way to Lady Alice, who was just then in Eaton
Square, and Lesley never dreamt of the tears that it brought
to her mother's eyes.</p>

<p>The letter was a shock to Lady Alice in more ways than
one. First, it showed her that on one point at least she
<i>had</i> been mistaken&mdash;and it was a point that had long been
a very sore one to her. Caspar had not meant the correspondence
between mother and daughter to cease&mdash;so he
said now; but she was certain that he had spoken very
harshly about it when the arrangement was first made.
He had even affected to doubt whether she had heart
enough to care whether she heard from her child or not.<a name="Page_180"></a>
Well, possibly he had altered his views since those days.
Lesley said that he <i>must</i> be different! Poor Lesley!
thought Lady Alice, how very little she knew! She seemed
to have been as much fascinated by her father as Lady
Alice had been, in days long past, by Caspar Brooke as a
lover; but Lady Alice reflected that <i>she</i> had never
thought of Caspar as good or gentle or "great" in any
way. She thought of him chiefly in his relation to herself,
and in that relation he had not been satisfactory. Yes,
she remembered well enough the sarcastic remarks, the
odd hours, the discomfort of her solitary meals. Lesley
could see all these points, and yet discover good in the
man, and not be disgusted? Lady Alice could not understand
her daughter's impartiality.</p>

<p>Of course&mdash;it had occurred to her once or twice&mdash;that,
being human, she <i>might</i> have been mistaken. She could
have got over the dreariness and discomfort of Caspar's
home, if Caspar had but loved her. Suppose&mdash;it was just
a remote possibility&mdash;Caspar had loved her all the time!</p>

<p>"The child has infected me with her romantic ideas,"
said Lady Alice, at last, with a faint, sad smile. "Let me
see&mdash;what does she say about her friends? The Kenyons&mdash;Ethel
Kenyon&mdash;Mr. Trent&mdash;the clergyman of the parish&mdash;Mr.
Kenyon&mdash;Mr. Kenyon I wonder who the Mr.
Kenyon is of whom she speaks so highly. Surely not a
clergyman too? Poor Caspar disliked clergymen so much.
I wonder if Mrs. Romaine is still living in the neighborhood.
But no, I remember: she went out to Calcutta and then to
some German baths with her husband. What became of
her, I wonder! If she were friendly with Caspar still,
<a name="tn_185"></a><!--TN: "Leslie" changed to "Lesley"-->Lesley would be sure to mention her to me!"</p>

<p>And she read the letter through once more. But Lesley
had not said a word about Mrs. Romaine: her heart had
been too hot and angry with the remembrance of what Mrs.
Romaine's brother had done, to lead her to say one word
about the family.</p>

<p>Lady Alice lingered curiously over Lesley's remarks on
"The Unexplored." She had not read the book herself.
She had seen it and heard of it very often&mdash;so often that she
thought she knew all that it contained. But for Lesley's
sake she resolved to read it now. Perhaps it held strange,
dangerous doctrines, against which her daughter ought to
be cautioned. Of course the house did not contain a copy.<a name="Page_181"></a>
But early in the day Lady Alice went to the nearest bookseller's
and bought a copy. The obliging book-seller, who
did not know her, remarked that "Brooke's 'Unexplored'"
was always popular, and asked her whether she would like
an unbound copy, or one bound in neat great cloth. Lady
Alice took the latter: she had a distaste for paper-covered
books.</p>

<p>She read "The Unexplored" in her own room that
morning, but of course she was not struck by it exactly as
Lesley had been. The facts which had horrified Lesley
were no novelties to her. She was, in truth, slightly angry
that her innocent Lesley should have so much of the great
city's misery and shame laid bare to her. She acknowledged
the truth of the portraiture, the beauty of the descriptions,
the eloquence of the author's appeals to the higher
classes; but she acknowledged it with resentment. Why
had Caspar written a book of this sort? a book that taunted
the higher classes with their birth, and reproached the
wealthy with their riches? It was rather a disgrace than
otherwise, in Lady Alice's aristocratic eyes, to be connected
in any way with the writer of "The Unexplored."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the book stirred in her the desire to vindicate
the worth of her order and of her sex; and the next
day, after having despatched a long and tender letter to
Lesley (with a formal message of thanks to her husband),
she went out to call on a lady, who was noted in her circle
as a great philanthropist, and mentioned to her in a timid
way that she wished she could be of any use amongst the
poor, but she really did not see what she could do.</p>

<p>Her friend, Mrs. Bexley, was nothing if not practical.</p>

<p>"But, my dearest Lady Alice, you can be of every use
in the world," she said. "I am going to drive to the East
End to-morrow morning, to distribute presents at the
London Hospital&mdash;it is getting so close to Christmas, you
know, that we really must not put it off any longer. I
generally go once a week to <a name="tn_186"></a><!-- TN: "vist" changed to "visit"-->visit the children and some of
the other patients. Won't you come with me?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I should be of very little use," said Lady
Alice.</p>

<p>"But we shall not want you to do anything&mdash;only to
say a kind word to the patients now and then, and give
them things."</p>

<p>"I think I could do that," said Lesley's mother, softly.<a name="Page_182"></a></p>

<p>She went back to her father's house quite cheered by
the unexpected prospect of something to do&mdash;something
which should take her out of the routine of ordinary work&mdash;something
which should bring her closer (though she
did not say it to herself) to the aims and objects of Lesley
and Caspar Brooke.</p>

<p>The visit was a great success. Lady Alice, with her tall,
graceful figure, her winning face, her becoming dress, was
a pleasant sight for the weary eyes of the women and
children in the accident wards. Mrs. Bexley was wise
enough not to take her near any very painful sights. Lady
Alice talked to some of the little children and gave them
toys: she made friends, rather shyly, with some of the
women, and promised to come and see them again. Mrs.
Bexley was well known in the hospital, and was allowed to
stay an unusually long time. So it happened that one of
the doctors, coming rather hurriedly into one of the wards,
paused at the sight of a lady bending over one of the
children's beds, and looked so surprised that one of the
nurses hastened to explain that the stranger came with old
Mrs. Bexley and was going away again directly.</p>

<p>The doctor nodded, and went straight up to the child's
bed. Lady Alice, raising herself after careful arrangement
of some wooden animals on the sick child's table, came
face to face with a very handsome man of about thirty,
who seemed to be regarding her with especial interest. He
moved away with a slight bow when she looked back at him,
but he did not go far. He paused to chat with another
little patient, and Lady Alice noticed that all the small
faces brightened at the sight of him, and that two or three
children called him imperiously to their bedsides. Something
about him vaguely interested her&mdash;perhaps it was
only his pleasant look, perhaps the affection with which he
was regarded, perhaps the expression which his face had
worn when he looked at her. She remembered him so
well that she was able when she paid a second visit to the
hospital to describe him to one of the Sisters, and ask
his name.</p>

<p>"Kenyon," she repeated, when it was told to her. "I
suppose it is not an uncommon name?"</p>

<p>Lesley had spoken of a Mr. Kenyon. It was not this
Mr. Kenyon, of course!</p>

<p>But it <i>was</i> "this Mr. Kenyon;" and thus Maurice met
the mother of the girl he loved in the ward of a London<a name="Page_183"></a>
hospital, whither Lady Alice had been urged by that impulse
towards "The Unexplored," of which her husband
was the author. And in another ward of the same hospital
lay a patient whose destiny was to influence the fates of
both&mdash;an insensible man, whose name was unknown to the
nurses, but whom Oliver would have recognized as his
brother, Francis Trent.<a name="Page_184"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">ETHEL REMONSTRATES.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> house in which the Kenyons resided was built on
the same pattern as Mr. Brooke's, but it was in some respects
very unlike Mr. Brooke's place of residence. Maurice's
consulting-room and dining-room corresponded,
perhaps, to Mr. Brooke's dining-room and study: it was
upstairs where the difference showed itself. Ethel's
drawing-room was like herself&mdash;a little whimsical, a little
bizarre; pretty, withal, and original, and somewhat unlike
anything one had ever seen before. She was fond of
novelties, and introduced the latest fashions in draperies or
china or screens as soon as she could get hold of them; and
the result was occasionally incongruous, though always
bright and cheerful-looking.</p>

<p>It was the incongruity of the ornaments and arrangements
which chiefly struck the mind of Oliver Trent as he entered
Ethel's drawing-room one afternoon, and stumbled over a
footstool placed where no footstool ought to be.</p>

<p>"I wish," he began, somewhat irritably, as he touched
Ethel's forehead with his lips, "that you would not make
your room quite so much like a fancy fair, Ethel."</p>

<p>Ethel raised her eyebrows. "Why, Oliver, only the
other day you said how pretty it was!"</p>

<p>"Pretty! I hate the word. As <a name="tn_189"></a><!--TN: Single quote moved to before "prettiness"-->if 'prettiness' could be
taken as a test of what was best in art."</p>

<p>"My room isn't <a name="tn_189a"></a><!-- TN: Double quote added after "'art'"-->'art,'" pouted Ethel; "it's <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>The sentence might be ungrammatical, but it was strictly
true. The room represented Ethel's character exactly. It
was odd, quaint, striking, and attractive. But Oliver was
not in the mood to see its attractiveness.</p>

<p>"It is certainly a medley," he replied, with some incisiveness.
"How many styles do you think are represented
in the place? Japanese, Egyptian, Renaissance, Louis
Quinze, Queen Anne, Early Georgian&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! please don't go on!" cried Ethel, with mock
earnestness. "<i>Not</i> Early Georgian, please! Anything
but that!"<a name="Page_185"></a></p>

<p>"It is all incongruous and out of taste," said Oliver, in
an ill-tempered tone, and then he threw himself into a deep,
comfortable lounging chair, and closed his eyes as if the
sight of the room were too much for his nerves.</p>

<p>Ethel remained standing: her pretty <i>mignonne</i> figure
was motionless; her bright face was thoughtful and overcast.</p>

<p>"Do you mean," she said, quietly, "that I am incongruous
and out of taste too!"</p>

<p>There was a new note in her voice. Usually it was light
and bird-like: now there was something a little more
weighty, a little more serious, than had been heard in it
before. Oliver noted the change, and moved his head
restlessly; he did not want to quarrel with Ethel, but he
was ill at ease in her presence, and therefore apt to be
exceedingly irritable with her.</p>

<p>"You wrest my words, of course," he answered. "You
always do. There's no arguing with&mdash;with&mdash;a woman."</p>

<p>"With <i>me</i> you were about to say. Don't spare me.
What other accusations have you to bring!"</p>

<p>"Accusations! Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"It is not nonsense, Oliver." Her voice trembled. "I
have felt for some time that all was not right between us.
I can't shut my eyes. I must believe what I see, and what
I feel. We must understand one another."</p>

<p>Oliver's eyes were wide open now. He began to see
that he had gone a little too far. It would not do to snub
Ethel too much&mdash;at least before the marriage. Afterwards&mdash;he
said to himself&mdash;he should treat her as he felt inclined.
But now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, Ethel," he said, in a tone of half
appeased vexation which he thought very effective. "What
on earth should there be wrong between us! Open your
eyes and your ears as much as you like, my dear child,
but don't be misled by what you <a name="tn_190"></a><!--TN: Quotation mark removed after "feel."-->feel. The wind is in the
East,&mdash;remember. You feel a chill, most probably, and
you put your <i>malaise</i> down to me."</p>

<p>His tone grew more affectionate as he spoke. He wanted
her to believe that he had been suffering from a mere
passing cloud of ill-temper, and that he was already
ashamed of it.</p>

<p>"I feel the effects of the weather myself," he said. "I
have been horribly depressed all day, and I have a head<a name="Page_186"></a>ache.
Perhaps that is why the brightness of your room
seemed to hurt my eyes. You know that I always like it
when I am well."</p>

<p>He looked at her keenly, hoping that this reference to
possible-ill-health might bring the girl to his feet, as it had
often done before in the case of other women; but it did
not seem to produce the least effect. She stood silent,
immobile, with her eyes still fixed upon the floor. Silence
and stillness were so unusual in one of Ethel's vivacious
temperament, that Oliver began to feel alarmed.</p>

<p>"Ethel," he said, advancing to her, and laying his hand
upon hers, "what is wrong? What have I done?"</p>

<p>She shook her head hastily, but made no other reply.</p>

<p>"Look at me," he said, softly.</p>

<p>And then she lifted her eyes. But they wore a questioning
and not a trustful look.</p>

<p>"Ethel, dearest, what have I done to offend you? It
cannot be my silly comment on your room that makes you
look so grave? Believe me, dear, it came only from my
headache and my bad temper. I am deeply sorry to have
hurt you. Only speak&mdash;scold me if you like&mdash;but do not
keep me in this suspense."</p>

<p>He was skilled in the art of pleading. His pale face,
usually so expressionless, took on the look of almost
passionate entreaty.</p>

<p>Ethel was an actress by profession&mdash;perhaps a little by
nature also&mdash;but she was too essentially simple-hearted to
suspect her friends of acting parts in private life, and indeed
trusted them rather more implicitly than most people
trust their friends. It had been a grief to her to doubt
Oliver's faith for a moment, and her eyes filled with
tears, while they flashed also with indignation, as she replied,</p>

<p>"You must know what I mean. I have felt it for a very
long time. You do not care for me as you used to do."</p>

<p>"Upon my soul, I do!" cried Oliver, very sincerely.</p>

<p>"Then you never cared for me very much."</p>

<p>This was getting serious. Oliver had no mind to break
off his engagement. He reserved the right to snub Ethel
without giving offence. If this was an impracticable course
to pursue, it was evident that he must abandon it and eat
humble pie. Anything rather than part from her just now.
He had lost the woman he loved: it would not do to lose
also his only chance of winning a competency for himself
and immunity from fear of want in the future.<a name="Page_187"></a></p>

<p>"Ethel," he said, softly, "you grieve me very much. I
acknowledge my faults of temper&mdash;I did not think you
mistook then for a want of love."</p>

<p>"I do not think I do. It is something more real, more
tangible than that."</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?"</p>

<p>She paused, then looked keenly into his face. "It
seems to me, Oliver, that Lesley Brooke has won your heart
away from me."</p>

<p>He threw back his head and laughed&mdash;a singularly
jarring and unpleasant laugh, as it seemed to her. "What
will you imagine next?" he said.</p>

<p>"Imagine? Have I imagined it? Isn't it true that
you have been at her house almost every day for the last
three or four weeks? Do you come here as often? Is it
not Lesley that attracts you?&mdash;not me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, so you are jealous!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose I am. It is only natural, I think."</p>

<p>They faced each other for a moment, defiantly, almost
fiercely. There was a proud light in Ethel's eyes, a compression
of the lips which told that she was not to be
trifled with. Oliver stood pale, with frowning brows, and
eyes that seemed to question both the reality of her feeling
and the answer that he should make to her demand. It
was by a great effort of self-control that at last he answered
her with calmness&mdash;</p>

<p>"I assure you, Ethel, you are utterly mistaken. What
have I in common with a girl like Miss Brooke&mdash;one of
the most curiously ignorant and wrong-headed persons
I ever came across? Can you think for a moment that
I should compare her with you?&mdash;<i>you</i>, beautiful and gifted
and cultured above most women?"</p>

<p>"That is nothing to the point," said Ethel, quickly.
"Men don't love women because of their gifts and their
culture."</p>

<p>"No," he rejoined, "but because of some subtle likeness
or attractiveness which draws one to the other. I find
it in you, without knowing why. You&mdash;I hoped&mdash;found
it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice became troubled; he dropped his eyes. Ethel
trembled&mdash;she loved him, poor girl, and she thought that
he suffered as she had suffered, and she was sorry for him.
But her outraged pride would not let her make any
advance as yet.<a name="Page_188"></a></p>

<p>"I may be a fatuous fool," said Oliver, after an agitated
pause, "but I thought you loved me."</p>

<p>"I do love you," cried Ethel, passionately.</p>

<p>"And yet you suspect me of being false to you."</p>

<p>"Not suspect&mdash;not suspect"&mdash;she said, incoherently,
and then, was suddenly folded in Oliver's arms, and felt
that the time for reproach or inquiry had gone by.</p>

<p>She was not sorry that matters had ended in this way,
although she felt it to be illogical. With his kisses upon
her mouth, with the pressure of his arm enfolding her, it was
almost impossible for her to maintain, in his presence, a
doubt of him. It was when he had gone that all the facts
which he had ignored came back to her with torturing insistence,
and that she blamed herself for not having refused
to be reconciled to him until she had ascertained the truth
or untruth of a report that had reached her ears.</p>

<p>With a truer lover she might have gone unsatisfied to
her dying day. A faithful-hearted man might never have
perceived where she was hurt; he would not have been
astute enough to discover that he might heal the wound by
a few timely words of <a name="tn_193"></a><!-- TN: Comma changed to period after "explanation"-->explanation. Oliver, keenly alive
to his own interests, reopened the subject a few days later
of his own accord.</p>

<p>They had completely made up their quarrel&mdash;to all outward
appearance, at any rate&mdash;and were sitting together
one afternoon in Ethel's obnoxious drawing-room. They
had been laughing together at some funny story of Ethel's
associates at the theatre, and to the laughter had succeeded
a silence, during which Oliver possessed himself of the
girl's hand and carried it gently to his lips.</p>

<p>"Ethel," he said, softly, "what made you so angry with
me the other day?"</p>

<p>"Your bad behavior, I suppose!" she said, trying to
treat the matter in her usual lively fashion.</p>

<p>"But what <i>was</i> my misbehavior? Did it consist in
going so often to the Brookes'?"</p>

<p>"Oh, what does it matter?" exclaimed Ethel, petulantly.
"Didn't we agree to forgive and forget? If we didn't,
we ought to have done. I don't want to look back."</p>

<p>"But you are doing an injustice to me. Ethel, I dare
not say to you that I <i>insist</i> on knowing what it was. But
I very strongly <i>wish</i> that you would tell me&mdash;so that I
might at least try to set your mind at rest."<a name="Page_189"></a></p>

<p>"Well," said Ethel, quickly, "if you <i>must</i> know&mdash;it was
only a bit of gossip&mdash;servants gossip. I know all that can
be said respecting the foolishness of listening to gossip
from such a source&mdash;but I can't help it. One of the maids
at Mr. Brooke's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sarah?" asked Oliver, with interest. "Sarah never
liked me."</p>

<p>"Who, it was not Sarah.&mdash;it was that maid of Lesley's&mdash;Kingston
her name is, I believe&mdash;who said to one of our
servants one day that you went there a great deal oftener
than she would like, if she were in my place. There! I
have made a full confession. It was a petty spiteful bit of
gossip, of course, and I ought not to have listened to it&mdash;but
then it seemed so natural&mdash;and I thought it might be
true!"</p>

<p>"What seemed natural?" said Oliver, who, against his
will, was looking very black.</p>

<p>"Why, that you should like Lesley; she is the sweetest
girl I ever came across."</p>

<p>In his heart Oliver echoed that opinion, but he felt
morally bound to deny it.</p>

<p>"You say so only because you have never seen yourself!
My darling, how could you accuse me merely on servants'
evidence!"</p>

<p>"Is there <i>no</i> truth in it, Oliver?"</p>

<p>"None in the least."</p>

<p>"But you do go there very often!"</p>

<p>Then Oliver achieved a masterpiece of diplomacy. "My
dear Ethel," he said, "I will go there no more until you go
with me. I will not set foot in the house again."</p>

<p>He knew very well that Mr. Brooke would not admit him.
It was clever to make a virtue of necessity.</p>

<p>"No, no, please don't do that! Go as often as you
please."</p>

<p>"It was simply out of kindness to a lonely girl. I played
her accompaniments for her sometimes, and listened to her
singing. But as you dislike it, Ethel, I promise you that I
will go there no more."</p>

<p>"Oh, Oliver, forgive me! I don't doubt you a bit. Do
go to see Lesley as often as you can. I should <i>like</i> you to
do it. Go for my sake."</p>

<p>But Oliver was quite obdurate. No, he would not go to
the Brookes' again, since Ethel had once objected to his<a name="Page_190"></a>
going. And on this pinnacle of austere virtue he remained,
thereby reducing Ethel to a state of self-abasement, which
spoke well for his chances of mastery in the married life
which loomed before him.<a name="Page_191"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">LADY ALICE'S PHILANTHROPY.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Meanwhile</span>, Lady Alice Brooke, in pursuit of her new
fancy for philanthropy and the sick poor, had wandered
somewhat aimlessly into other wards beside those set apart
for women and children&mdash;at first the object of her search.
She strayed&mdash;I use the word "strayed" designedly, for
she certainly did not do it of set purpose&mdash;with one of the
nurses into accident wards, into the men's wards, where
her flowers and fruits and gentle words made her welcome,
and where the bearded masculine faces, worn sometimes by
pain and privation of long standing, appealed to her sensibilities
in a new and not altogether unpleasant way.</p>

<p>For Lady Alice was a very feminine creature, and liked,
as most women do like, to be admired and adored. She
had confessed as much when she told the story of her life
to her daughter Lesley. And she had something less than
her woman's due in this respect. Caspar Brooke had very
honestly loved and admired her, but in a protective and
slightly "superior" way. The earl, her father, belonged
to that conservative portion of the aristocratic class which
treats its womankind with distinguished civility and profoundest
contempt. In her father's home Lady Alice felt
herself of no account. As years increased upon her, the
charm of her graceful manner was marred by advancing
self-distrust. In losing (as she, at least, thought) her
physical attractions, she lost all that entitled her to consideration
amongst the men and women with whom she lived.
She had no fixed position, no private fortune, nothing that
would avail her in the least when her father died; and
the gentle coldness of her manner did not encourage
women to intimacy, or invite men to pay her attentions
that she would scorn. In any other situation, her natural
gifts and virtues would have fairer play. As a spinster,
she would still have had lovers; as a widow, suitors by <a name="tn_196"></a><!-- TN: "the the" changed to "the"-->the
dozen; as a happily married woman she would have<a name="Page_192"></a>
been courted, complimented, flattered, by all the world.
But, as a woman merely separated from a husband with
whom she had in the first instance eloped, living on sufferance,
as it were, in her father's house, "neither maid, wife,
nor widow," she was in a situation which became more
irksome and more untenable every year.</p>

<p>To a woman conscious of such a jar in her private life,
it was really a new and delightful experience to find herself
in a place where she could be of some real use, where
she was admired and respected and flattered by that unconscious
flattery given us sometimes by the preference of
the sick and miserable. The men in one of the accident
wards were greatly taken with Lady Alice. There was her
title, to begin with; there were her gracious accents, her
graceful figure, her gentle, beautiful face. The men liked
to see her come in, liked to hear her talk&mdash;although she
was decidedly slow, and a little irresponsive in conversation.
It soon leaked out, moreover, that material
benefits followed in the wake of her visits. One man,
who left the hospital, returned one day to inform his mates
that, "the lady" had found work for him on her father's
estate, and that he considered himself a "made man for
life." The attentions of such men who were not too ill
to be influenced by such matters were henceforth concentrated
upon Lady Alice; and she, being after all a
simple creature, believed their devotion to be genuine,
and rejoiced in it.</p>

<p>With one patient, however, she did not for some time
establish any friendly relations. He had been run over,
while drunk, the nurses told her, and very seriously hurt.
He lay so long in a semi-comatose condition that fears
were entertained for his reason, and when the mist gradually
cleared away from his brain, he was in too confused a
state of mind for conversation to be possible.</p>

<p>Lady Alice went to look at him from time to time, and
spoke to the nurse about him; but weeks elapsed before
he seemed conscious of the presence of any visitor. The
nursing sister told the visitor at last that the man had
spoken and replied to certain questions: that he had
seemed uncertain about his own name, and could not
give any coherent account of himself. Later on, it transpired
that the man had allowed his name to be entered
as "John Smith."<a name="Page_193"></a></p>

<p>"Not his own name, I'm certain," the nurse said, decidedly.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Lady Alice asked, with curiosity.</p>

<p>"It's too common by half for his face and voice," the
Sister answered, shrewdly. "If you look at him or speak
to him, you'll find that that man's a gentleman."</p>

<p>"A gentleman&mdash;picked up drunk in the street?"</p>

<p>"A gentleman by birth or former position, I mean," said
the Sister, rather dryly. "No doubt he has come down in
the world; but he has been, at any rate, what people call
an educated man."</p>

<p>Lady Alice's prejudices were, stirred in favor of the
broken-down drunkard by this characterization; and she
made his acquaintance as soon as he was able to talk. Her
impression coincided with that of the Sister. The man had
once been a gentleman&mdash;a cultivated, well-bred man, from
whom refinement had never quite departed. Over and
above this fact there was something about him which utterly
puzzled Lady Alice. His face recalled to her some one
whom she had known, and she could not imagine who
that some one might be. The features, the contour
the face, the expression, were strangely familiar to her. For,
by the refining forces which sickness often applies, the
man's face had lost all trace of former coarseness or <a name="tn_198"></a><!-- TN: "commoness" changed to "commonness"-->commonness:
it had become something like what it had been in
the days of his first youth. And the likeness which puzzled
Lady Alice was a very strong resemblance to the patient's
sister, Rosalind Romaine.</p>

<p>Lady Alice was attracted by him, visited his bedside very
often, and tried to win his confidence. But "John Smith"
had, at present, no confidence to give. Questions confused
and bewildered him. His brain was in a very excitable
condition, the doctor said, and he was not to be tormented
with useless queries. By the time his other injuries had
been cured, he might perhaps recover the full use of his
mind, and could then give an account of himself if he liked.
Till then he was to be let alone; and so Lady Alice contented
herself with bringing him such gifts as the authorities
allowed, and with talking or reading to him a little from time
to time in soothing and friendly tones. It was to be noted
that before long his eyes followed her with interest as she
crossed the ward; that his brow cleared when she spoke to
him, and that all her movements were watched by him with<a name="Page_194"></a>
great intentness. In spite of this she could not get him to
reply with anything but curtness to her inquiries after his
health and general welfare; and it was quite a surprise to
her when one day, on her visit to him, he accosted her of his
own accord.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?" he said suddenly.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Yes, I should like to sit and read to you
a little if you are able&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It isn't for that," he said, interrupting her unceremoniously;
"it's because I have something special to say to you.
If you'll stoop down a moment I'll say it&mdash;I don't want
any one else to hear."</p>

<p>In great surprise, Lady Alice bowed her head.
"I want to tell you," he said gruffly, "that you're
wasting your time and your money. These men in the
ward are not really grateful to you one bit. They speculate
before you come as to how much you are likely to
give them, and when you are gone they compare notes
and grumble if you have not given them enough."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to hear this," said Lady Alice, with
dignity.</p>

<p>"I know you do not; but I think it is only right to tell
you. Try them: give them nothing for a visit or two,
and see whether they won't sulk and look gloomy, although
you may talk to them as kindly as ever&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And if they did," said Lady Alice, with a sudden flash
of energy and insight which amazed herself, "who could
blame them, considering the pain they have suffered, and
the brutal lives they lead? Why should they listen to my
poor words, if I go to them without a gift in my hand?"</p>

<p>She spoke as she would have spoken to an equal&mdash;an
unconscious tribute to the refinement which stamped this
man as of a higher calibre than his fellows.</p>

<p>"It is a convenient doctrine for them," said John Smith,
and buried his head in the bedclothes as if he wanted to
hear nothing more.</p>

<p>For Lady Alice's next two visits he would not look up,
or respond when she came near him, which she never
failed to do; but on the third occasion he lifted his head.</p>

<p>"Well, madam," he said, "you have after all been trying
my plan, I hear. Do you find that it works well?"</p>

<p>Lady Alice hesitated. The averted faces and puzzled,
downcast&mdash;sometimes sullen&mdash;looks of the sick men and<a name="Page_195"></a>
boys to whom she had of late given nothing but kind
words, had grieved her sorely.</p>

<p>"I suppose it proves the truth, in part, of what you say,"
she answered gently, "but on the other hand I find that
my gifts have been judged excessive and unwise. It
seems that I have a great deal to learn in the art of giving:
it does not come by nature, as some suppose. I have
consulted the doctors and nurses&mdash;and I have to thank
you for giving me a warning."</p>

<p>A look of surprise passed across the man's face.</p>

<p>"You're better than some of them," he said, curtly. "I
thought you'd never look at me again. I don't know why
I should have interfered. But I did not like to see you
cheated and laughed at."</p>

<p>Lady Alice colored, but she felt no resentment against
the man, although he had shown her that she had made
herself ridiculous when she was bent on playing Lady
Bountiful, and posing as an angel of light. She said after
a moment's pause&mdash;</p>

<p>"I believe you meant kindly. Is there nothing that I
can do for you?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I don't think so&mdash;I can't remember
very well. The doctors say I shall remember by and
by. Then I shall know."</p>

<p>"And if I can, you will let me help you?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I ought to be only too glad," said the patient,
with a sort of sullenness, which Lady Alice felt that she
could but dimly understand. "I suppose I'm the sort of
man to <i>be</i> helped; and yet I can't help fancying there's a&mdash;Past&mdash;a
Past behind me&mdash;a life in which I once was
proud of my independence. But it strikes me that this was
very long ago."</p>

<p>He drew the bedclothes over his head again, and made no
further reply. Lady Alice came to see him after this conversation
as often as the rules of the hospital would allow
her; and, although she seemed to get little response from
him, the fact really remained that she was establishing an
ascendancy over the man such as no nurse or doctor in
the place had yet maintained. Others noticed it beside
herself; but she, disheartened a little by her disappointment
in some of the other patients, did not recognize the
reality of his attachment to her. And an event occurred
about the time which put John Smith and hospital matters
out of her head for a considerable time to come.<a name="Page_196"></a></p>

<p>Old Lord Courtleroy died suddenly. He was an old
man, but so hale and hearty that his death had not been
expected in the least; but he was found dead in his bed
one morning, and the doctors pronounced that his complaint
had been heart disease. The heir to the title and
estate was a distant cousin whom Lady Alice and her father
had never liked; and when he entered upon his possessions,
Lady Alice knew that the time had come for her to
seek a home elsewhere. She had sufficient to live upon;
indeed, for a single woman, she was almost rich; but the
loneliness of her position once more forced itself upon her,
especially as Lesley was not by her side to cheer her
gradually darkening life.</p>

<p>She wrote the main facts concerning Lord Courtleroy's
death and the change in her circumstances in short, rather
disjointed letters to Lesley, and received very tender
replies; but even then she felt a vague dissatisfaction with
the girl's letters. They were full of a wistfulness which
she could not understand: she felt that something remote
had crept into them, some aloofness for which she could
not account. And as Captain Harry Duchesne happened
to come across her one day, and inquired very particularly
after Miss Brooke, she induced him to promise to call on
Lesley when he was in London, and to report to her all
that Lesley did or said. If it was a somewhat underhand
proceeding, she told herself that she was justified by her
anxiety as a mother.</p>

<p>Lord Courtleroy had left a considerable sum to Lesley,
and when mother and daughter were reunited, as Lady
Alice hoped that they would shortly be, there was no
question as to their having means enough and to spare.
Lady Alice began to dream of a dear little country house
in Sussex, with an occasional season in London, or a winter
at Bagn&egrave;res. She was recalled from her dreams to the
realities of life by a letter from her husband. Caspar
Brooke wrote to ask whether, under present circumstances,
she would not return to him.<a name="Page_197"></a></p>

<p class="chapterhead">CAPTAIN DUCHESNE.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Lesley's</span> life seemed to her now much less lonely than it
had been at first. The consciousness of having made
friends was pleasant to her, although her affection for
Ethel had been for a time overshadowed by the recollection
of Oliver's unfaithfulness. But when this impression
passed away, as it gradually did, after the scene that had
been so painful to her, she consoled herself with the belief
that Oliver's words and actions had proceeded from a
temporary derangement of judgment, for which he was not
altogether responsible, and that he had returned to his
allegiance; therefore she might continue to be friendly
with Ethel without any sensation of treachery or shame.
An older woman than Lesley would not, perhaps, have
argued in this way: she would have suspected the permanence
of Oliver's feelings more than Lesley did. But,
being only an inexperienced girl, Lesley comforted herself
by the fact that Oliver now avoided her; and said that it
could not be possible for her to have attracted him away
from Ethel, who was so winning, so sweet, so altogether
delightful.</p>

<p>Then, apart from the Kenyons, she began to make
pleasant acquaintances amongst her father's friends. Caspar
Brooke's house was a centre of interest and entertainment
for a large number of intellectual men and women;
and Lesley had as many opportunities for wearing her
pretty evening gowns as she could have desired. There
were "at homes" to which her charming presence and her
beautiful voice attracted Caspar's friends in greater numbers
than ever: there were dinner-parties where her interest
in the new world around her made everything else
interesting; and there was a constant coming and going
of people who had work to do in the world, and who did
it with more or less success, which made the house in
Woburn Place anything but a dull abode.<a name="Page_198"></a></p>

<p>The death of her grandfather distressed her less from
regret for himself than from anxiety for her mother's future.
Lady Alice's notes to her were very short and somewhat
vaguely worded. It was, therefore, with positive joy that,
one afternoon in spring, she was informed by her maid
that Captain Duchesne was in the drawing-room, for she
felt sure that he would be able to tell her many details
that she did not know. She made haste to go down, and
yet, before she went, she paused to say a word to Kingston,
who had brought her the welcome news.</p>

<p>"I wish you would go out, Kingston; you don't look
at all well, and this spring air might do you good."</p>

<p>It was certainly easy to see that Kingston was not well.
During the past few weeks her face had become positively
emaciated, her eyes were sunken, and her lips were white.
She looked like a person who had recently passed through
some illness or misfortune. Lesley had tried, delicately
and with reserve, to question her; but Kingston had never
replied to any of her inquiries. She would shut up her
lips, and turn away with the look of one who could keep a
secret to the grave.</p>

<p>"Nothing will do me good, ma'am," she answered
dryly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Kingston, I am so sorry!"</p>

<p>"Go down to your visitor, ma'am, and don't mind me,"
said Kingston, turning her back on the girl with unusual
abruptness. "It isn't much that I've got to be sorry for,
after all."</p>

<p>"If there is anything I can do to help you, you will let
me know, will you not?" said Lesley.</p>

<p>But Kingston's "Yes, ma'am," fell with a despairing
cadence on her ear.</p>

<p>Kingston had been to her husband's lodgings only to find
that he had disappeared. He had left some of his clothes,
and the few articles of furniture that belonged to his wife,
and had never said that he was going away. The accident
that had made Francis Trent a patient at the hospital
where Lady Alice visited was of course unknown to his
landlady, as also to his wife. And as his memory did not
return to him speedily, poor Mary Trent had been left to
suffer all the tortures of anxiety for some weeks. At first
she thought that some injury had happened to him&mdash;perhaps
that he was dead: then a harder spirit took posses<a name="Page_199"></a>sion
of her, and she made up her mind that he had finally
abandoned her&mdash;had got money from Oliver and departed
to America without her. She might have asked Oliver
whether this were so, but she was too proud to ask. She
preferred to eat out her heart in solitude. She believed
herself deserted forever, and the only grain of consolation
that remained to her was the hope of making herself so
useful and acceptable to Lesley Brooke, that when <a name="tn_204"></a><!--TN: "Leslie" changed to "Lesley"-->Lesley
married she would ask Mary Kingston to go with her to
her new home.</p>

<p>Kingston had made up her mind about the man that
Lesley was to marry. She had seen him come and go:
she had seen him look at her dear Miss Lesley with
ardently admiring eyes: she believed that he would be a
true and faithful husband to her. But she knew more
than Lesley was aware of yet.</p>

<p>Lesley went slowly down into the drawing-room. She
remembered Captain Duchesne very well, and she was
glad to think of seeing him again. And yet there was an
indefinable shrinking&mdash;she did not know how or why.
Harry Duchesne was connected with her old life&mdash;with the
Paris lights, the Paris drawing-rooms, the stately old
grandfather, the graceful mother&mdash;the whole assembly of
things that seemed so far away. She did not understand
her whole feeling, but it suddenly appeared to her as if
Captain Duchesne's visit was a mistake, and she had better
get it over as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that this sensation vanished as soon
as she came into the actual presence of Captain Duchesne.
The young man, with his grave, handsome features, his
drooping, black moustache, his soldierly bearing, had an
attraction for her after all. He reminded her of the mother
whom she loved.</p>

<p>It was not very easy to get into conversation with him
at first. He seemed as ill at ease as Lesley herself had
been. But when she fell to questioning him about Lady
Alice, his tongue became unloosed.</p>

<p>"She does not know exactly what to do. She talks of
taking a house in London&mdash;if you would like it."</p>

<p>"Would mamma care to live in London?"</p>

<p>"Not for her own sake: for yours."</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;I do not think I like London so much," said
Lesley, with a swift blush and some hesitation. Captain
Duchesne looked at her searchingly.<a name="Page_200"></a></p>

<p>"Indeed? I understood that you had become much
attached to it. I am sure Lady Alice thinks so."</p>

<p>"I do love it&mdash;yes, but it is on account of the people
who live in London," said Lesley.</p>

<p>"Ah, you have made friends?"</p>

<p>"There is my father, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes." And something in his tone made Lesley change
the subject hurriedly. Captain Duchesne would never
have been so ill-bred as to speak disparagingly of a lady's
father to her face; and yet she felt that there was something
disparaging in the tone.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the present Lord Courtleroy?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; I have met him once or twice. He is somewhat
stiff and rigid in appearance, but he is very courteous&mdash;more
than courteous, Lady Alice tells me, for he is kind.
He wishes to disturb her as little as possible&mdash;entreats her
to stay at Courtleroy, and so on; but naturally she wishes
to have a house of her own."</p>

<p>"Of course. But I thought that she would prefer the
South of France."</p>

<p>"If I may say so without offence," said Captain Duchesne,
smiling, "Lady Alice's tastes seem to be changing. She
used to love the country and inveigh against the ugliness of
town; but now she spends her time in visiting hospitals
and exploring Whitechapel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lesley almost sprang to her feet. "Oh, Captain Duchesne,
are you in earnest?"</p>

<p>"Quite in earnest."</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>am</i> so glad!"</p>

<p>"Why, may I ask?" said Duchesne, with real curiosity.
But Lesley clasped her hands tightly together and hung
her head, feeling that she could not explain to a comparative
stranger how she felt that community of interests
might tend to a reconciliation between the long separated
father and mother. And in the rather awkward pause that
followed, Miss Ethel Kenyon was announced.</p>

<p>Lesley was very glad to see her, and glad to see that
she looked approvingly at Captain Duchesne, and launched
at once into an animated conversation with him. Lesley
relapsed almost into silence for a time, but a satisfied
smile played upon her lips. It seemed to her that Captain
Duchesne's dark eyes lighted up when he talked to<a name="Page_201"></a>
Ethel as they had not done when he talked to <i>her</i>; that
Ethel's cheeks dimpled with her most irresistible smile,
and that her voice was full of pretty cadences, delighted
laughter, mirth and sweetness. Lesley's nature was so
thoroughly unselfish, that she could bear to be set aside
for a friend's sake; and she was so ingenuous and single-minded
that she put no strained interpretation on the
honest admiration which she read in Harry Duchesne's
eyes. It may have been partly in hopes of drawing her
once more into the conversation that he turned to her
presently with a laughing remark anent her love of smoky
London.</p>

<p>"Oh, but it is not the smoke I like," Lesley answered.
"It is the people."</p>

<p>"Especially the poor people," put in Ethel, saucily.
"Now, I can't bear poor people; can you, Captain Duchesne?"</p>

<p>"I don't care for them much, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"I like to do them good, and all that sort of thing,"
said Ethel. "Don't look so sober, Lesley! I like to act
to them, or sing to them, or give them money; but I must
say I don't like visiting them in the slums, or having to
stand too close to them <i>anywhere</i>. I am so glad that you
agree with me, Captain Duchesne!"</p>

<p>And not long afterwards she graciously invited him to
call upon her on "her day," and promised him a stall at
an approaching <i>matinee</i>, two pieces of especial favor, as
Lesley knew.</p>

<p>Captain Duchesne sat on as if fascinated by the brilliant
little vision that had charmed his eyes; and not until an
unconscionable time had elapsed did he seem able to tear
himself away. When he had gone, Ethel expressed herself
approvingly of his looks and manners.</p>

<p>"I like those soldierly-looking men," she said. "So
well set up and distinguished in appearance. Is he an old
friend of yours, <a name="tn_206"></a><!-- TN: Exclamation mark changed to question mark after "Lesley"-->Lesley?"</p>

<p>"No, I have met him only once before. In Paris, he
dined with us&mdash;with my grandfather, my mother, and myself."</p>

<p>"And he comes from Lady Alice now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to bring me news of her."</p>

<p>Ethel nodded her bright little head sagaciously.</p>

<p>"It's very plain what Lady Alice wants, then?"<a name="Page_202"></a></p>

<p>"What?" said Lesley, opening her eyes in wide amaze.</p>

<p>"She wants you to marry him, my dear."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"It's not nonsense: don't get so red about it, you silly
girl. What a baby you are, Lesley."</p>

<p>"I am sure mamma never thought of anything of the
kind," said Lesley, with dignity, although her cheeks were
still red.</p>

<p>"We shall see what we shall see. Well, I won't put my
oar in&mdash;isn't that kind of me? But, indeed, your Captain
Duchesne looks thoroughly ripe for a flirtation, and it will
be as much as I can do to keep my hands off him."</p>

<p>"How would Mr. Trent like that?" said Lesley, trying
to carry the war into the enemy's camp.</p>

<p>"He would bear it with the same equanimity with which
he bears the rest of my caprices," said Ethel, merrily; but
a shade crossed her brow, and she allowed Lesley to lead
the conversation to the subject of her <i>trousseau</i>.</p>

<p>Captain Duchesne did not seem slow to avail himself of
the favor accorded to him. He presented himself at
Ethel's next "at home;" and devoted himself to her with
curious assiduity. Even the discovery of her engagement
to Mr. Trent did not change his manner. It was not so
much that he paid her actual attention, as that he paid
none to anybody else. When she was not talking to him,
he kept silence. He seemed always to be observing her,
her face, her manner, her dress, her attitude. Yet this
kind of observation was quite respectful and unobtrusive:
it was merely its continuity that excited remark. Oliver
noticed it at last, and professed himself jealous: in fact he
was a little bit jealous, although he did not love Ethel
overmuch. But he had a pride of possession in her which
would not allow him to look with equanimity on the prospect
of her being made love to by anybody else.</p>

<p>Ethel enjoyed the attentions, and enjoyed Oliver's jealousy,
in her usual spirit of childlike gaiety. She was quite
assured of Oliver's affection for her now; and she looked
forward with shy delight to the day of her wedding, which
had been fixed for the twentieth of March.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Oliver was devoured with secret anxiety. For
what had become of Francis, and when would he appear to
demand the money which had been promised to him on
the day when the marriage should take place?<a name="Page_203"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">MR. BROOKE'S DESIRES.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Lady Alice's</span> movements were not without interest to
Caspar Brooke, although Lesley did not suspect the fact.
It was quite a surprise to her when he entered the library
one day, with apparently no other object than that of saying
abruptly,</p>

<p>"What is your mother going to do, Lesley?"</p>

<p>"To do?" said Lesley, flushing slightly and looking
astonished.</p>

<p>"Yes"&mdash;impatiently. "Where is she going to live?
What will become of her? Do you want to go to her? I
wish to hear what you know about her arrangements."</p>

<p>He planted himself on the hearth-rug in what might be
termed an aggressive attitude&mdash;really the expression of
some embarrassment of feeling. It certainly seemed hard
to him at that moment to have to ask his daughter these
questions.</p>

<p>"I think," said Lesley, with downcast eyes, "that she
is trying to find a house to suit her in Mayfair."</p>

<p>"Mayfair. Then half her income will go in rent and
taxes. Will she live there alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes. At least&mdash;unless&mdash;until&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Until you join her: I understand. Will"&mdash;and then
he made a long pause before continuing&mdash;"if she wants
you to join her at once; and you wish to go, don't let this
previous arrangement stand in the way. I shall not interfere."</p>

<p>His curtness, his abruptness, would once have startled
and terrified Lesley. She had of late grown so much less
afraid of him, that now she only lifted her eyes, with a
proud, grieving look in them, and said,</p>

<p>"Do you want me to go away, then?"</p>

<p>"<i>Want</i> you to go? Certainly not, child," and Mr.
Brooke stretched out his hand, and drew her to him with a<a name="Page_204"></a>
caressing gesture. "No: I like to have you here. But I
thought you wanted to go to her."</p>

<p>"So I do," said Lesley, the tears coming to her eyes.
"But&mdash;I want to stay, too. I want"&mdash;and she put both
hands on his arms with a gesture as affectionate as his own&mdash;"I
want my father and mother both."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that is an impossible wish."</p>

<p>"But why should it be?" said Lesley, looking up into
his face beseechingly.</p>

<p>His features twitched for a moment with unwonted
emotion. "You know nothing about it," he said&mdash;but he
did not speak harshly. "You can't judge of the circumstances.
What can I do? Even if I asked her she would
not come back to me."</p>

<p>And then he put his daughter gently from him and went
down to his study, where he paced up and down the floor
for a good half-hour, instead of settling down as usual to
his work.</p>

<p>But Lesley's words were not without their effect, although
he had put them aside so decidedly. With that young,
fair face looking so pleadingly into his own, it did not seem
impossible that she should form a new tie between himself
and his wife. Of course he had always known that children
were conventionally supposed to bind the hearts of husband
and wife to each other; but in his own case he had
not found that a daughter produced that result. On the
contrary, Lesley had been for many years a sort of bone of
contention between himself and his wife; and he had retained
a cynical sense of the futility of such conventional
utterances, which were every day contradicted by barefaced
facts.</p>

<p>But now he began to acknowledge that Lesley was drawing
his heart closer to his wife. The charm of a family
circle began to rise before him. Pleasant, indeed, would
it be to find that his dingy old house bore once more the
characteristics of a home; that womankind was represented
in it by fairer faces and softer voices than the face and
voice even of dear old Doctor Sophy, with her advanced
theories, her committees, and her brisk disregard of the
amenities of life. Yes, he would give a good deal to see
Alice&mdash;it was long since he had thought of her by that
name&mdash;established in his drawing-room (which she should
refurbish and adorn to her heart's content), with Lesley by<a name="Page_205"></a>
her side, and himself at liberty to stroll in and out, to be
smiled upon, and&mdash;yes, after all, this was his dearest wish&mdash;to
dare to lavish the love of which his great heart was
full upon the wife and child whose loss had been the misfortune
of his life.</p>

<p>As he thought of the past years, it seemed to him that
they had been very bleak and barren. True, he had done
many things; he had influenced many people, and accomplished
some good work; but what had he got out of it for
himself? He was an Individualist at heart, as most men
are, and he felt conscious of a claim which the world had
not granted. It was almost a shock to him to feel the
egoistic desire for personal happiness stirring strongly
within him; the desire had been suppressed for so long,
that when it once awoke it surprised him by its vitality.</p>

<p>The outcome of these reflections was seen in a letter
written that day after his talk with Lesley. He seated
himself at last at his writing-table, and after some minutes'
thought dashed off the following epistle. He did not stop
for a word, he would not hesitate about the wording of
sentences: it seemed to him that if he paused to consider,
his resolution might be shaken, his purpose become unfixed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"My Dear Alice," he wrote&mdash;"I hear from Lesley that
you are looking for a house. Would it not be better for us
all if you made your home with me again? Things have
changed since you left me, and I might now be better able
to consult your tastes and wishes than I was then. We
are both older and, I hope, wiser. Could we not manage
to put aside some of our personal predilections and make
a home together for our daughter? I use this argument
because I believe it will have more weight with you than
any other: at the same time, I may add that it is for my
own sake, as well as for Lesley's, that I make the proposition.
Your affectionate husband,</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Caspar Brooke.</span>"
</p></div>

<p>It was an odd ending, he thought: he had certainly
not shown himself an affectionate husband to her for many
years. But there was truth in the epithet: little as she
might believe it, or as it might appear. He would not<a name="Page_206"></a>
stop to re-read the letter: he had said what he wanted to
say, and she could read his meaning easily enough. He
had held out the olive branch. It was for her to accept
or reject it, as she would.</p>

<p>Lesley could not understand why he was so restless and
apparently uneasy during the next few days. He seemed
to be looking for something&mdash;expecting something&mdash;nobody
knew what. He spent more time than usual with
her, and took a new interest in her affairs. She did not
know that he was trying to put himself into training for
domestic life, and that he found it unexpectedly pleasant.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he said one day, picking up a scrap of
paper that fell from a book that she held in her hand.
"Not a letter, I think? Have you been making extracts?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lesley, blushing violently, but not trying to
take the paper from him.</p>

<p>"May I see it? Oh, a sort of essay&mdash;description&mdash;impressions
of London in a fog." He murmured a few of the
words and phrases as he went on. "Why, this is very
good. Here's the real literary touch. Where did you get
this, Lesley? It's not half bad."</p>

<p>As she made no answer, he looked up and saw the guilty
laughter in her eyes, the conscious blushes on her cheeks.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I only wrote it to amuse myself," said Lesley, meekly.
"I've had so little to do since I came here, and I thought
I would scribble down my impressions."</p>

<p>"My dear child," said Mr. Brooke, "if you can write as
well as this, you ought to have a career before you. Why,"
he added, surveying her, "I had no idea of this. And I
always did have a secret wish that a child of mine should
take to literature. My dear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I don't want to take to literature, exactly," said
Lesley, with a little gasp. "I only want to amuse myself
sometimes&mdash;just when I feel inclined, if you don't think it
a great waste of time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Waste of time? Certainly not. Go on, by all means.
I shall only ask to see what you do now and then; I might
be able to give you a hint&mdash;though I don't know. Your
style is very good already&mdash;wants a little compression,
perhaps, but you can make sentences&mdash;that's a comfort."
And Mr. Brooke fell to reading the manuscript again, with
a very pleased look upon his face.<a name="Page_207"></a></p>

<p>It was while he was still reading that a servant brought
in some letters which had just arrived. He opened the
first that came to hand almost unthinkingly, for his mind
was quite absorbed in the discovery which he had made.
It was only when his eye rested on the first page of the
letter that memory came back to him. He gave a great
start, rose up, putting Lesley's paper away from him, and
went to the other side of the room to read his letter. It
was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Brooke</span>,&mdash;
</p>

<p>"I have already found a house that I think will suit me, and I hope
that Lesley will join me there as soon as you can spare her. I am
afraid that it is a little too late to change our respective ways of life.
It would be no advantage to Lesley to live with parents who were not
agreed.</p>

<p class="presignature">"Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="signature">"<span class="smcap">Alice Brooke.</span>"</p>
</div>

<p>Caspar Brooke turned round with a face that had grown
strangely pale, walked across the room to Lesley, and
dropped the letter in her lap.</p>

<p>"There!" he said. "I have done my uttermost. That
is your mother's reply to me."</p>

<p>He strode out of the room, without deigning to answer
her cry of surprise and inquiry, and Lesley took up the
letter.</p>

<p>It was with a burst of tears that she put it down. "Oh,
mother, mother!" she cried to herself, "how can you be
so unkind, so unjust, so unforgiving? He is the best man
in the world, and yet you have the heart to hurt him."</p>

<p>She did not see her father again until the next day, and
then, although she made no reference in words to the letter
which she restored to him, her pale and downcast looks
spoke for her, and told the sympathy which she did not
dare to utter. Mr. Brooke kissed her, and felt vaguely
comforted; but it began to occur to him that he had made
Lesley's position a hard one by insisting on her visit to his
house, and that it might have been happier for her if she
had remained hostile to himself, or ignorant of his existence.
For now, when she went back to her mother, would not the
affection that she evidently felt for him rise up as a barrier
between herself and Lady Alice? Would she not try to
fight for him? She was brave enough, and impetuous<a name="Page_208"></a>
enough, to do it. And then Alice might justly accuse him
of having embittered the relation, hitherto so sweet, between
mother and daughter, and thereby inflicted on her an injury
which nothing on earth could repair or justify.</p>

<p>Could nothing be done to remedy this state of things?
Caspar Brooke began to feel worried by it. His mind was
generally so serene that the intrusion of a personal anxiety
seemed monstrous to him. He found it difficult to write
in his accustomed manner: he felt a diminution of his
interest in the club. With masculine impatience of such
an unwonted condition, he went off at last to Maurice
Kenyon, and asked him seriously whether his brain, his
heart, or his liver were out of order. For that something
was the matter with him, he felt sure, and he wanted the
doctor to tell him what it was.</p>

<p>Maurice questioned and examined him carefully, then
assured him with a hearty laugh that even his digestion
was in the best possible working order.</p>

<p>Brooke gave himself a shake like a great dog, looked
displeased for a moment, and then burst out laughing too.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is nothing, after all," he said. "I've been
a trifle anxious and worried lately. Nothing of any importance,
my dear fellow. By the by, have you been to see
Lesley lately?"</p>

<p>"May I speak to her?" said Maurice, his face brightening.
"I thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Speak when you like," Caspar answered, curtly. "I
almost wish you would get if over. Get it settled, I
mean."</p>

<p>"I shall get it settled as soon as I can, certainly," said
Maurice.</p>

<p>And Mr. Brooke went away, thinking that after all he
had found one way of escape from his troubles. For if
Lesley accepted Maurice, and lived with him in a house
opposite her father's, there would always be a corner for
him at their fireside, and he would not go to the grave feeling
himself a childless, loveless, desolate old man.</p>

<p>It must be conceded that Mr. Brooke had sunk to a very
low pitch of dejection when he was dominated by such
thoughts as these.<a name="Page_209"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">LESLEY'S PROMISE.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Maurice</span> was no backward lover. He made his way to
Lesley that very day, and found her in the library&mdash;not, as
usual, bending over a book, but standing by the window,
from which could be seen a piece of waste ground overgrown
with grass and weeds, and shaded by some great
plane and elm trees. There was nothing particularly fascinating
in the outlook, which partook of the usual grimness
of a London atmosphere; but the young green of the
budding trees spoke, in spite of the blackness of their
branches, of spring and spring's delight; and there was a
brightness in the tints of the tangled grass which gave a
restful satisfaction to the eye. Lesley was looking out
upon this scene with a wistfulness which struck Maurice
with some surprise.</p>

<p>"You like this window?" he said, interrogatively, when
they had shaken hands and exchanged a word or two of
greeting.</p>

<p>"Yes, it reminds me in some way of my old convent
home; I don't know why it should; but there are trees
and grass and greenness."</p>

<p>"Ah, you love the country?"</p>

<p>"Do not you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but there are better things in the world than even
trees and grass."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," said Lesley, eagerly. Then, with a little
smile, she added; as if quoting&mdash;"Souls of men."</p>

<p>"I was thinking of their bodies," said the young doctor.
"But that's as it should be. You think of the spiritual, I
only of the material side. Both sides ought to be considered
that is where men and women meet, I take it."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Lesley, a little vaguely.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," Maurice went on, "that it will be a long
time before I have a country house of my own: a place
where there will be trees and green meadows and flowers,<a name="Page_210"></a>
such as one loves and sighs for. I have often thought"&mdash;with
a note of agitation in his voice&mdash;"how much easier it
would be to ask any one to share my life if I had these
good things to offer. My only chance has been to find
someone who cares&mdash;as I care&mdash;for the souls and bodies
of the men and women around us; who would not disdain
to help me in my work."</p>

<p>"Who <i>could</i> disdain it?" asked Lesley, innocently
indignant.</p>

<p>"Do you mean"&mdash;turning suddenly upon her&mdash;"that
you don't consider a hard working doctor's life something
inexpressibly beneath you?"</p>

<p>She drew back a little hurt, a little bit astonished.</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Why should I?"</p>

<p>"You are born to a life of luxury and self-indulgence."</p>

<p>"My father is a journalist," said Lesley with a smile, in
which amusement struggled with offence.</p>

<p>"But your grandfather was an earl! It is possible,"
with a touch of raillery, "that you prefer earls to general
practitioners."</p>

<p>"Of the two, it is the doctor that leads the better life,
in my opinion," said Lesley, rather hotly; but immediately
cooling down, she added the remark&mdash;"My preferences
have nothing much, however, to do with the matter."</p>

<p>"Have they not? How little you know your own power!"</p>

<p>Lesley looked at him in much amaze. Whither this
conversation was tending it had not yet occurred to her to
inquire. But something in his look, as he stood fronting
her, brought the color to her cheeks and caused her eyes
to sink. She became suddenly a little afraid of him, and
wished herself a thousand miles away. Indeed she made
one backward step, as if her maidenly instincts were about
to manifest themselves in actual flight. But Maurice saw
the movement, and made two steps forward, which brought
him so close to her that he could have touched her hand
if he had wished.</p>

<p>"Don't you understand?" he said, in an agitated voice.
"Don't you see that your opinion&mdash;your preferences&mdash;are
all the world to me?"</p>

<p>He paused as if expecting her to reply&mdash;leaning a little
towards her to catch the word from her lips. But Lesley
did not speak. She remained motionless, as pale now as
she had been red before&mdash;her hands hanging at her sides<a name="Page_211"></a>
and her eyes fixed upon the ground. She looked as if she
were stricken dumb with dismay.</p>

<p>"I know that I have not recommended myself to you by
anything that I have said or done," Maurice went on. "I
misjudged you once, and I spoke roughly, rudely, brutally;
but it was the way you took what I said which made me
understand you. You were so fine, so noble, so sweet!
Instead of making my stupidity an excuse for shutting
yourself away from what your father was doing, you immediately
threw yourself into it, you began to work with
him and for him&mdash;as of course I might have seen that
you would do directly you came to know him. I was a
fool, and you were an angel&mdash;that summarizes the situation."</p>

<p>A faint smile curled Lesley's lips, although she did not
look up. "I am afraid there is not much of the angel
about me," she said.</p>

<p>"Ah, you can't see yourself as others see you," he
answered, quite ignoring the implication in her remark
which a less ardent lover might have resented. "To
me, at any rate, you are the one woman in the world, the
only one I have ever loved&mdash;shall ever love as long as I
live&mdash;the fulfilment of my ideal&mdash;the realization of all my
<a name="tn_216"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "dreams!"-->dreams!"</p>

<p>His vehemence made Lesley draw back.</p>

<p>"You exaggerate," she said with a slight shake of the
head. "Indeed, I am not all that&mdash;I could not be. I am
very ignorant and full of faults. I have a bad temper&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have a temper that is sweetness itself!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Kenyon, how can you say so?"&mdash;with a look
of reproach. "You who have seen me so angry!"</p>

<p>"Your temper is just like your father's," said Maurice,
dogmatically. "A little hot, if you like, but sweet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Something like preserved ginger?" asked Lesley.</p>

<p>The two young people looked at each other with laughter
in their eyes. This was Lesley's way of trying to stave off
the inevitable. If Maurice's declaration could only be
construed into idle compliment, she would be rid of the
necessity of giving him a plain answer. And what had
been begun as a proposal of marriage seemed likely to
degenerate into a fencing match.</p>

<p>Maurice saw the danger, and was too quick-witted to
fall unawares into the trap which Lesley had laid for him.
A war of words was the very thing in which he and Ethel<a name="Page_212"></a>
most delighted; and it was usually quite easy to induce
brother and sister to engage upon it. But on this occasion
he was too much in earnest for word-play. He laughed at
Lesley's simile, and then became suddenly and almost
fiercely grave.</p>

<p>"I can't let you turn the whole thing into a joke," he
said. "You know that I mean what I say. It is a matter
of life and death to me. I love you with my whole heart,
and I come to-day to know whether there is any chance for
me&mdash;whether you can honor me with your love&mdash;whether
you will one day consent to be my wife."</p>

<p>His voice sank to a pleading tone, and his face was very
pale. But he felt that a great display of emotion would
frighten and repel the girl, and he therefore sedulously
avoided, as far as possible, any appearance of agitation.
He could not, however, entirely achieve the calmness which
he desired, and the very suppression of his agitation, which,
in spite of himself, made his voice shake, and brought
fire to his eyes, had an unwontedly unnerving effect upon
Lesley.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," she said hurriedly. "I can't tell&mdash;I
never thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Think now," he said persuasively. "Am I disagreeable
to you?"</p>

<p>"No,"&mdash;very softly.</p>

<p>"Have you forgiven me for my bad behavior in the
past?"</p>

<p>"You never did behave badly."</p>

<p>"But you have forgiven me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>This was illogical, as she had previously intimated that
there was nothing to forgive; but, under such circumstances,
Lesley may be excused.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;surely, then&mdash;you like me a little!"</p>

<p>"A little," Lesley breathed, rather than spoke, with an
unconscious smile of happiness.</p>

<p>"Can you not call it 'loving?'" asked Maurice, daring
for the first time to take her soft little hand in his.</p>

<p>But the question, the look, the touch, suddenly terrified
Lesley, and brought back to her mind a long-forgotten
promise. What was it her mother had required of her
before she left Paris for her father's house? Was it not a
pledge that she should not bind herself to marry any man?<a name="Page_213"></a>
&mdash;that she should not engage herself to be married?
Lesley had an instinctive knowledge of the fact that to
proclaim her promise would be to cast discredit on Lady
Alice; and so, while trying to keep her word, she sought
for means to avoid telling the whole truth.</p>

<p>"No, oh no," she said, withdrawing her hand at once
and turning away. "Indeed, I could not. Please do not
ask me anymore."</p>

<p>The shock was very great to Maurice. He stood perfectly
silent for a moment. He had thought that he was making
such good progress&mdash;and, behold! the wind had suddenly
changed; the face of the heavens was overcast. He tried
to think that he had been mistaken, and made another
attempt to win a favorable hearing.</p>

<p>"Miss Brooke&mdash;Lesley&mdash;you say you like me a little.
Do you not think that your liking for me might grow?
When you know that I love you so tenderly, that I would
lay down my very life for you, when you can hear all that
I can tell you of my hopes, my dreams, my aspirations&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not want to hear," said Lesley, putting out her
hand blindly. "Please do not tell me: it makes me miserable&mdash;indeed,
I must not listen."</p>

<p>Again Maurice stood silent for a moment.</p>

<p>"<i>Must</i> not listen?" he repeated at length, with a keen
look at her. "Why must you not?"</p>

<p>Lesley made no answer.</p>

<p>"You speak strangely," said Kenyon, with some slight
coldness beginning to manifest itself in his manner. "Why
should you not listen to me? If you are thinking of your
father, I can assure you that he has no objection to me. I
have consulted him already. He would be honestly glad,
I believe, if you could care for me&mdash;he has told me so.
Does his opinion go for nothing?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I can't explain," she said brokenly. "I can only ask
you not to say anything&mdash;at least&mdash;I have promised&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Promised not to listen to me?"</p>

<p>"To anything of the kind," said Lesley, feeling that she
was making a terrible mess of the whole affair, and yet
unable to loosen her tongue sufficiently to explain.</p>

<p>"May I ask to whom you gave this promise?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lesley.<a name="Page_214"></a></p>

<p>There was another silence, but this time it was a silence
charged with ominous significance. Maurice's face was very
white, and a peculiar rigidity showed itself in the lines of
his features. He was very much disappointed, and he also
felt that he had some right to be displeased.</p>

<p>"If you were bound by any such promise, Miss Brooke,"
he said, "I think it would have been better that your
friends should have known of it. I don't think that Mr.
Brooke was aware&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, he knew nothing about it."</p>

<p>"It was a promise made before you came here?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Of which your mother&mdash;Lady Alice&mdash;approves?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;it was to her&mdash;because she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lesley stammered and tried to explain. There was a tremendous
oppression upon her, such as one feels sometimes
in a nightmare dream. She longed to speak out, to clear
herself in Maurice's eyes, and yet she could not frame a
single intelligible sentence. It was as though she were
afflicted with dumbness.</p>

<p>"I think," said Maurice, deliberately, "that your father
and your aunt had a right to know this fact. You seem
to have kept them in ignorance of it. And I have been
led into a mistake. I can assure you, Miss Brooke, that
if I had been aware of any previous promise&mdash;or&mdash;or engagement
of yours, I should never have presumed to speak
as I have spoken to-day. I can but apologize and withdraw."</p>

<p>Before Lesley could answer, he had taken his hat, bowed
profoundly, and left the room.</p>

<p>And Lesley, with lips from which all color had faded,
and hands pressed tightly together, watched him go, and
stood for some minutes in dazed, despairing silence before
she could say, even to herself, with a burst of hot and bitter
tears,</p>

<p>"Oh, I did not mean him to think <i>that</i>. And now I
cannot explain! What shall I do? What <i>can</i> I do to
make him understand?"</p>

<p>But that was a question for which she found no answer.<a name="Page_215"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">CURED.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">"You</span> are quite well," said the doctor to John Smith,
otherwise called Francis Trent, at the great hospital one
day. "You can go out to-morrow. There is nothing more
that we can do for you."</p>

<p>Smith raised his dull eyes to their faces.</p>

<p>"Am I&mdash;cured?" he asked.</p>

<p>One of the doctors shrugged his shoulders a little. Another
answered kindly and pityingly,</p>

<p>"You will find that you are not as strong as you used
to be. Not the same man in many respects. But you will
be able to get your own living, and we see no reason for
detaining you here. What was your trade?"</p>

<p>The patient looked down at his white, thin hands. "I
don't know," he said.</p>

<p>"Have you friends to go to?"</p>

<p>There was a pause. Some of the medical students who
were listening came a little nearer. As a matter of fact,
Francis Trent's future depended very largely on the answer
he made to this question. The statement that he was
"quite well" was hazarded rather by way of experiment
than as a matter of fact. The doctors wanted to know
what he would say and do under pressure, for some of
them were beginning to suggest that the man should be
removed to the workhouse infirmary or a lunatic asylum.
His faculties seemed to be hopelessly beclouded.</p>

<p>Suddenly he lifted his head. A new sharp light had
come into his eyes. He nodded reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have friends," he said.</p>

<p>"You have a home where you can go? Shall we write
to your friends to meet you?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, sir. I can find my own way home."</p>

<p>And then they conferred together a little, and left him,
and reported that he was cured.</p>

<p>Certainly, there seemed to be nothing the matter with
him now. His wounds and injuries had healed, his bodily<a name="Page_216"></a>
strength was returning. But the haze which hung over his
mind was far more impenetrable than the doctors guessed.
Something of it had been apparent to them in the earlier
days of his illness; but his clear and decided answers to
their questions convinced them that memory had to some
extent returned. As a matter of fact it was not memory
that had returned, but a sharpening of his perceptive faculties,
awakening him to the fact that he stood in danger of
being taken for an idiot or a madman if he did not frame
some answer to the questions which the doctors asked him.
This new acuteness was perhaps the precursor to a return
of his memory; but as yet the Past was like a dead wall,
an abyss of darkness surrounding him. Now and then
flashes of light seemed to dart across that darkness: he
seemed on the point of recalling something&mdash;he knew not
what; for the flashes faded as quickly as they came, and
made the darkness all the greater for the contrast.</p>

<p>He was possessed now by the idea that if he could get
out of hospital, and walk along the London streets, he
might remember all that he had forgotten. His own name,
his own history, had become a blank to him. He knew
in some vague, forlorn fashion, that he had once been what
the world calls a gentleman. He had not acknowledged so
much to the doctors: he had not felt that they would
believe him. Even when the groping after the Past became
most painful, he made up his mind that he would not ask
these scientific men for help: he was afraid of being
treated as a "case," experimented on, written about in the
papers. There was something in the Past of which he
knew he ought to be ashamed. What could it be? He was
afraid to ask, lest he might find himself to be a criminal.</p>

<p>In these haunting terrors there was, of course, a distinct
token of possible insanity. The man needed a friendly,
guiding hand to steer him back to the world of reason and
common-sense. But to whom could he go, since he had
taken up this violent prejudice against the doctors? He
felt drawn to none of the nurses, although some of them
had been very kind to him. The only person to whom
he might perhaps have disburthened himself, if he had had
the opportunity, was the sweet-voiced, sweet-faced woman
whom he had warned of the ill effects of her gifts. He did
not know her name, or anything about her; but before he
left the hospital he asked one of the nurses who she was.<a name="Page_217"></a></p>

<p>"Lady Alice Brooke&mdash;daughter of the Lord Courtleroy,
who died the other day," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Could you give me her address?"</p>

<p>"No; and I don't think that if I could it would be of
any use to you. She is leaving England, I believe. If
you want work or help, why don't you speak to Mr.
Kenyon? He's the gentleman to find both for you&mdash;Mr.
Maurice Kenyon."</p>

<p>"Which is Mr. Kenyon?"</p>

<p>"There&mdash;he's just passing through the next ward; shall
I speak to him for you?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you: I don't want anything from him: I
only wanted the lady's name," said John Smith, in a dogged
sullen kind of way, which made the whitecapped nurse
look at him suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Brooke!&mdash;Kenyon?"&mdash;How oddly familiar the names
seemed to him! Of course they were not very uncommon
names; but there was a distinct familiarity about them
which had nothing to do with the names themselves, as if
they had some connection with his own history and his
own affairs.</p>

<p>He was discharged&mdash;"cured." He went out into the
streets with half-a-crown in his pocket, and a fixed determination
to know the truth, sooner or later, about himself.
At the same time he had a great fear of letting any one
know the extent of the blanks in his memory. He thought
that people might shut him up in a madhouse if he told
them that he could not recollect his own name. A certain
amount of intellectual force and knowledge remained to
him. He could read, and understand what he read. But
of his own history he had absolutely no idea; and the only
clue to it that he could find lay in those two names&mdash;Brooke
and Kenyon.</p>

<p>Could he discover anything about the possessors of
these names which would help him? He entered a shop
where a Post Office Directory was to be found, and looked
at Maurice Kenyon's name amongst the doctors. He
found Mr. Kenyon's private address; but as yet it told
him nothing. Woburn Place? Well, of course he had
heard of Woburn Place, it was no wonder that he should
know it so well; but the name told him nothing more.</p>

<p>He sat staring at it so long that the people of the shop
grew impatient, and asked him to shut the book. He went<a name="Page_218"></a>
away, and wandered about the streets, vaguely seeking for
he knew not what. And after a time he bought a newspaper.
Here again he found the name that had attracted
his attention&mdash;the name of Kenyon. "Last appearance of
Miss Kenyon at the Frivolity Theatre&mdash;this week only."</p>

<p>"Who's Miss Ethel Kenyon?" he asked&mdash;drawing a
bow at a venture&mdash;of his neighbor in the dingy little coffeehouse
into which he had turned. It was ten to one that
the man would not know; but he would ask.</p>

<p>As it happened, the young <a name="tn_223"></a><!--TN: "nan" changed to "man"-->man did know. "She's an
actress," he said. "I went to see her the other night.
Pretty girl&mdash;going to get married and leave the stage. My
brother's a scene shifter at the Frivolity&mdash;knows all about
her."</p>

<p>"Who is she going to marry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know&mdash;some idle young chap that wants
her money, I believe. She ain't the common sort of actress,
you know. Bit of a swell, with sixty thousand pounds of
her own."</p>

<p>"Oh," said his interlocutor, vaguely. "And&mdash;has she
any relations?"</p>

<p>"Well, that I can't tell you. Stop a bit, though: I did
hear tell of a brother&mdash;a doctor, I believe. But I couldn't
be sure of it."</p>

<p>"Could you get to know if you wanted?"</p>

<p>The young fellow turned and surveyed his questioner
with some doubt. "Dare say I could if I chose," he said.
"What do you want to know for, mate?"</p>

<p>"I've been away&mdash;out of England for a long time&mdash;and
I think they're people who used to know me," said Francis
Trent, improvising his story readily. "I thought they
could put me on the way of work if I could come across
them; but I don't know if it's the same."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go to see her to-night? She's worth a
look: she's a pretty little thing&mdash;but she don't draw
crowds: the gallery's never full."</p>

<p>"I think I'll go to-night," said Francis, rising suddenly
from his seat. He fancied that the young man looked at
him suspiciously. "Yes, no doubt, I should know her if
I saw her: I'll go to-night."</p>

<p>He made his way hastily into the street, while his late
companion sent a puzzled glance after him. "Got a tile
loose, that chap has," he said to the girl at the counter as
he also passed out. "Or else he was a bit screwed."<a name="Page_219"></a></p>

<p>So that night Francis Trent went to the Frivolity, and
witnessed, from a half-empty gallery, a smart, sparkling
little society play, in which Ethel Kenyon had elected to
say farewell to her admirers.</p>

<p>He saw her, but her face produced no impression upon
his mind.</p>

<p>It was not familiar to him, although her name was familiar
enough. Those gleaming dark eyes in the saucy piquante
face, the tiny graceful figure, the silvery accents of
her voice, were perfectly strange to him. They suggested
absolutely nothing. It was the name alone that he knew;
and he was sure that it was in some way connected with
his own.</p>

<p>Before the end of the play, he got up and went out.
The lights of the theatre made him dizzy: his head ached
from the hot atmosphere and from his own physical weakness.
He was afraid that he should cry out or do something
strange which would make people look at him, if he
sat there much longer. So he turned into a side street and
leaned against a wall for a little time, until he felt cool and
refreshed. The evening was warm, considering that the
month was March, and the air that played upon his face
was soft and balmy. When he had recovered himself a
little, he noticed a group of young men lighting their cigarettes
and loitering about a door in the vicinity. Presently
he made out that this was the stage-door, and that these
young men were waiting to see one of the actresses come
out. By the fragments of their talk that floated to him on
the still evening air in the quiet side street, Francis Trent
gathered that they spoke a good deal of Ethel Kenyon.</p>

<p>"So this is the last we shall see of pretty little Ethel,"
he heard one man say. "Who's the man she's hooked,
eh?"</p>

<p>Nobody seemed to know.</p>

<p>"Why did she go on the boards at all, I wonder? She's
got money, and belongs to a pre-eminently respectable
family. Her brother's a doctor."</p>

<p>"Stage-struck," said another. "She'll give it up now,
of course. Here's her carriage. She'll be here directly."</p>

<p>"And the happy man at her heels, I <a name="tn_224"></a><!-- TN: Quotation mark moved to follow "suppose,"-->suppose," sneered
the first speaker. "They say she's madly in love with him,
and that he, of course, wants her money."</p>

<p>"He's a cad, I know that," growled a younger man.<a name="Page_220"></a></p>

<p>Impelled by an interest of which he himself did not
know the source, Francis Trent had drawn nearer to the
stage door as the young fellows spoke. He was quite close
to it, when it opened at last and the pretty actress came
forth.</p>

<p>She was escorted by a train of admirers, rich and poor.
Her maid was laden with wraps and bouquets. The manager
and the actor who played the leading part were on
either side of her, and Ethel was laughing the merry, unaffected
laugh of a perfectly happy woman as she made her
triumphal exit from the little theatre where she had achieved
all her artistic success. Another kind of success, she
thought, was in store for her now. She was to know another
sort of happiness. And the whole world looked very
bright to her, although there was one little cloud&mdash;no bigger
than a man's hand, perhaps&mdash;which had already shown
itself above the horizon, and might one day cloud the
noontide of her love.</p>

<p>Francis Trent was so absorbed in watching her lovely
face, and in wondering why her name had seemed so familiar,
that he paid scant attention to her followers. It was
only as the carriage drove off that his eye was caught by
the face of a man who sat beside her. A gleam from a gas-lamp
had fallen full upon it, revealing the regular, passionless
features, the dark eyes and pale complexion of Ethel's
lover. And as soon as he saw that face, a great change
came over the mental condition of Francis Trent. He stood
for a moment as if paralyzed, his worn features strangely
convulsed, a strange lurid light showed itself in his haggard
eyes. Then he threw his arms wildly in the air,
uttered a choked, gasping cry, and rushed madly and
vainly after the retreating carriage, heedless of the shouts
which the little crowd sent after him.</p>

<p>"He's mad&mdash;he'll never catch up that carriage! What
does he run after it for, the fool?" said one of the men on
the pavement.</p>

<p>And indeed he soon relinquished the attempt, and sat
down on a doorstep, panting and exhausted, with his face
buried upon his arms.</p>

<p>But he was not mad. He was sure of that now. It was
only that he had&mdash;partially and feebly, but to some extent
effectually&mdash;remembered what had happened to him in the
dark dead Past.<a name="Page_221"></a></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">DOUBT.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">It</span> was a difficult matter for Maurice Kenyon so to word
his report to Caspar Brooke as not to excite his displeasure
<a name="tn_226"></a><!-- TN: "againt" changed to "against"-->against Lesley. He felt himself bound to respect
Lesley's confidences&mdash;if such they might be called&mdash;respecting
the promise which kept her from returning his
love; but he could not help a certain bitterness of tone in
referring to his interview with her; and his friend observed
the bitterness.</p>

<p>"What reason did she give for refusing you?" he asked
sharply.</p>

<p>"I suppose she does not care for me."</p>

<p>"There is something else&mdash;to judge from your look.
Perhaps there is&mdash;somebody else?" said Brooke.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know that I'm doing right in telling you&mdash;but&mdash;God
help me!&mdash;I believe there is," said Maurice,
with a groan.</p>

<p>"She did not tell you who?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Mr. Brooke knitted his brows. He was inclined to think
that Oliver Trent had produced an impression on Lesley's
susceptible heart. He could not ask questions of any of
the persons concerned; but he had his suspicions, and
they made him angry as well as anxious.</p>

<p>He made it his business during the next day or two to
find out whether Oliver had been to the house since the
day when he had interrupted the interview; but he could
not learn that he had ventured there again. It was no use
asking Dr. Sophy about Lesley's comings and goings: it
was almost impossible for him to question Lesley herself.</p>

<p>"What rubbish it all is&mdash;this love-making, marrying,
and giving in marriage!" he said, at last, impatiently, to
himself. "I'll think no more about these young folks'
affairs&mdash;let them make or mar their happiness in their own
way. I'll think of my work and nothing else&mdash;I've ne<a name="Page_222"></a>glected
it a good deal of late, I fancy. I must make up for
lost time now." And sitting down at his table, he turned
over the papers upon it, and took up a quill pen. But he
did not begin to write for some minutes. He sat frowning
at the paper, biting the feathers of his pen, drumming with
his fingers on the table. And after a time he muttered to
himself, "If any man harms Lesley, I'll wring his neck&mdash;that's
all;" which did not sound as though he were giving
to his literary work all the attention that it required.</p>

<p>As to Lesley, she would have given a great deal at that
time for a counsellor of some kind. The old feeling of friendlessness
had come back to her. Her aunt was absorbed
by her own affairs, her father looked at her with unquiet
displeasure in his eyes. Oliver Trent had proved himself
a false friend indeed. Ethel was a little reserved with her,
and she had sent Maurice Kenyon away. There was
nobody else to whom she could turn for comfort. True,
she had made many acquaintances by this time: her father's
circle was a large one, and she knew more people now than
she had ever spoken to in her quiet convent days. But
these were all acquaintances&mdash;not friends. She could not
speak to any one of these about Maurice Kenyon, her
lover and her friend. Once or twice she thought vaguely
of writing to her mother about him; but she shrank from
doing so without quite knowing why. The fact was, she
knew her mother's criticism beforehand: she expected to
be reproached with having broken her compact in the spirit
if not in the letter; and she did not know how to justify
herself. Maurice had taken his dismissal as final, and she
had not meant him to do so. Now, if ever, the girl wanted
a friend who would either encourage her to explain her position
to him, or would do it for her. Lady Alice would
not fill this post efficiently. And Lesley, in her youthful
shamefaced pride, felt that nothing would induce her to
make her own explanation to Maurice. It would seem like
asking him to ask her again to marry him&mdash;an insupportable
thought.</p>

<p>So she went about the house pale and heavy-eyed, trying
with all her might to throw herself into her father's schemes
for his club, writing a little now and then, occupying herself
feverishly with all the projects that came in her way,
but bearing a sad heart about with her all the time. She
was not outwardly depressed&mdash;her pride would not let her<a name="Page_223"></a>
seem melancholy. She held her head high, and talked and
laughed more than usual. But the want of color and brightness
in her face and eye could not be controlled.</p>

<p>"You pale-faced wretch," she said to herself one Saturday
evening, as she stood before her glass and surveyed the
fair image that met her eye; "why cannot you look as usual?
It must be this black dress that makes me so colorless: I
wish that I had a flower to wear with it."</p>

<p>Mr. Brooke and his sister were holding one of their frequent
Saturday evening parties, when they were "at home"
to a large number of guests. Lesley was just about to go
downstairs. Her dress was black, for she was in mourning
for her grandfather; and it must be confessed that the
sombre hue made her look very pale indeed. The wish
for a flower was gratified, however, almost as soon as
formed. Kingston entered her room at that moment carrying
a bouquet of flowers, chiefly white, but with a scarlet
blossom here and there, which would give exactly the
touch of color that Lesley's appearance required.</p>

<p>"These flowers have just come for you, ma'am," Kingston
said quietly.</p>

<p>Her subdued voice, her pale face, and heavily shadowed
eyes, did not make her a cheerful-looking messenger; but
Lesley, for the time being, thought of nothing but the
flowers.</p>

<p>"Where do they come from, Kingston?" she asked,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"I was only to say one word, ma'am&mdash;that they came
from over the way."</p>

<p>There was no want of color now in Lesley's face. Her
cheeks were rose-tinted, her eyes had grown strangely
bright. "Over the way." Of course that meant Maurice.
Did not he live over the way?&mdash;and was there any one else
at the Kenyons' house who would send her such lovely
flowers?</p>

<p>If he sent her flowers, she reflected, he could not have
yet ceased to care for her, although she had behaved so
badly to him&mdash;in his eyes, at least. The thought gave her
courage and content. Perhaps he was coming that night&mdash;he
had a standing invitation to all the Brookes' evening
parties&mdash;and when he came he would perhaps "say something"
to her, something which she could answer suitably,
so as to make him understand.<a name="Page_224"></a></p>

<p>She did not know how pretty she looked as she stood
looking down at her flowers, the color and smile and dimples
coming and going in her fair young face in very unwonted
confusion. But Mary Kingston noted every change of tint
and expression, and was surprised. For the little mystery
was quite plain to her. It was not Mr. Kenyon who sent
the flowers at all. Mr. Kenyon was too busy a man to buy
bouquets. It was Oliver Trent who had sent them, for
Kingston had herself seen him carrying the flowers and
entrusting them to a commissionnaire with a message for
Miss Brooke. She believed, too, that Lesley knew from
whom they came. But she was not sufficiently alert and
interested just then to make these matters of great importance
to her. She did not think it worth her while to say
how much she knew. With a short quick sigh she turned
away, and expected to see her young mistress quit the
room at once, still with that happy smile upon her face.
But Lesley had heard the sigh.</p>

<p>"Oh, Kingston," she said, laying her hand on the
woman's arm, "I wish you would not sigh like that!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, ma'am; I did not mean to annoy
you."</p>

<p>"I don't mean <i>that</i>: I mean it for your own sake. You
seem so sad about something&mdash;you have been sad so long!"</p>

<p>"I've had a sad life, Miss Lesley."</p>

<p>"But there is surely some special sadness now?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the woman slowly. "Yes, that is true. I've&mdash;lost&mdash;a
friend."</p>

<p>She put a strong emphasis on the word "lost," and
paused before and after uttering it, as if it bore a peculiar
meaning to her. But Lesley took the word in its ordinary
sense.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," she said. "It must be very terrible,
I think, when one's friends die."</p>

<p>She stood silent for a minute&mdash;a shadow from Kingston's
grief troubling the sweetness of her fair face. It was the
maid who broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, ma'am; I oughtn't to have troubled you
with my affairs to-night, just when you're enjoying yourself
too. But it's hard sometimes to keep quiet."</p>

<p>Moved by a sudden instinct of sympathy, Lesley turned
and kissed the woman who served her, as if she had been
a sister. It was in such ways that she showed her kinship<a name="Page_225"></a>
with the man who had written "The Unexplored." Lady
Alice, in spite of all her kindness of heart, would never
have thought of kissing her ladies' maid.</p>

<p>"Don't grieve&mdash;don't be sorrowful," said Lesley. "Perhaps
things will mend by and by."</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear," said Kingston, forgetting her <a name="tn_230"></a><!-- TN: Removed quotation mark after "position,"-->position,
as Lady Alice would have said, while that young, soft kiss
was warm upon her cheek, "the dead don't come back."</p>

<p>And when Lesley had gone downstairs, with the white
and scarlet bouquet in her hand, Mary Kingston sat down
and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>It was not the first time that Lesley had spoken words of
consolation to her; but on this occasion her gentleness
had gone home to Mary Kingston's heart as it had never
done before. After weeping for herself for a time, she fell
to weeping for Lesley too, for it seemed inevitable to her
that Lesley should suffer before very long. She believed
that Lesley was in love with Oliver, and that for this reason
only had she refused Maurice Kenyon, which shows that
Lesley had kept her own secret very well.</p>

<p>"I'd do anything to keep her from harm," said Mary
Kingston, with a passionate rush of gratitude towards the
girl for her kindly words and ways. "Francis Trent
<a name="tn_230a"></a><!-- TN: "brough" changed to "brought"-->brought me grief enough, God knows; and if she's going
to throw herself away on Oliver, she'll have her heart broke
sooner than mine. For I've been used to sorrow all my
days; and she&mdash;poor, pretty lamb&mdash;she don't know what
it means. And Miss Brooke all taken up with her medicine-fads,
and Mr. Brooke only a <i>man</i>, after all, in spite of
his goodness; and my lady, her mother, far away and
never coming near her&mdash;if anybody was friendless and forlorn,
it's Miss Lesley. Only me between her and her ruin,
maybe! But I'll prevent it," said the woman, rising to
her feet with a strange look of exaltation in her sunken
eyes: "I'll guard her from Oliver Trent as I couldn't guard
my own sister, poor lass! I'll see that she does not come
to any harm, and if he means ill by her I'll shame him before
all the world, even though I break more hearts than
one by it."</p>

<p>And then she roused herself from her reverie, and went
downstairs, where she knew that her presence was required
in the tea-room. Scarcely had she entered it, when she
made a short pause and gave a slightly perceptible start.<a name="Page_226"></a>
For there stood Ethel Kenyon, with Oliver Trent in attendance.
She had not thought that he would come to the
house; a rumor had gone about that he had quarreled with
Mr. Brooke; yet there he was, smiling, bland, irreproachable
as ever, with quite the look of one who had the right
to be present. He was holding Ethel's fan and gloves as
she drank a cup of tea, and seemed to be paying her every
attention in his power. Ethel, in the daintiest of costumes,
was laughing and talking to him as they stood together.
<i>She</i> was quite unconscious of any reason for his possible
absence. Mary Kingston gave them a keen glance as she
went by, and decided in her own mind that there was more
in the situation than as yet she had understood.</p>

<p>Oliver was playing a bold game. His marriage was
fixed for the following Tuesday. From Mr. Brooke's attitude
in general towards the Kenyons, he felt sure that
Caspar would not place them in any painful or perplexing
situation. He would not, for instance, refuse to welcome
Oliver to his house again, if Oliver went in Ethel's company.
Accordingly, the young man put his pride and his
delicacy (if he had either&mdash;which is doubtful) in his
pocket, and went with his affianced wife to Mr. Brooke's
Saturday evening party.</p>

<p>"For I will see Lesley again," he said to himself, "and
if I do not go to-night I may not have the opportunity. If
she would relent, I would not mind throwing Ethel over&mdash;I
could do it so easily now that Francis has disappeared.
But I would give up Ethel's twenty thousand, if Lesley
would go with me instead!"</p>

<p>Little did he guess that only on the previous night had
he been recognized and remembered by that missing brother,
whose tottering brain was inflamed almost to madness
by a conviction of deliberate wrong; or that this brother
was even now upon his track, ready to demand the justice
that he thought had been denied him, and to punish the
man who had brought him to this evil pass! Wild and
mad as were the imaginings of Francis Trent's bewildered
mind, they boded ill to his brother Oliver whenever the two
should meet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ethel's lover, with a white flower in his button-hole,
occupied the whole evening in leaning idly against
a wall, and feasting his eyes on the fair face and form&mdash;not
of his betrothed, but&mdash;of Lesley Brooke.<a name="Page_227"></a></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">IN MR. BROOKE'S STUDY.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Caspar Brooke's</span> dingy drawing-room looked cheerful
enough that night, filled by a crowd of men and women,
and animated by the buzz of constant talk and movement.
It was a distinguishing characteristic of his parties that
they were composed more of men than of women; and the
guests were often men or women who had done something
in the world, and were known for some special excellence
in their work. Lesley generally enjoyed these gatherings
very much. The visitors were shabby, unfashionable people
sometimes: they had eccentricities of dress and manner;
but they were always interesting in Lesley's eyes. Literary
men, professors, politicians, travelers, philanthropists, faddists&mdash;these
were the folk that mostly frequented Caspar
Brooke's parties. Neither artists nor musicians were largely
represented: the flow of talk was rather political and
literary than artistic; and on the whole there were more
elderly people than young ones. As a rule, Oliver Trent
was not disposed to frequent these assemblies: he shrugged
his shoulders at them and called them "slow," but on this
occasion he was only too glad to find admittance. It was
at least a good opportunity for watching Lesley, as she
passed from one group to another, doing the duties of
assistant-hostess with grace and tact, giving a smile to one,
a word to another, entering into low-toned conversation,
which brightened her eyes and flushed her fair cheek, with
another. Oliver thought her perfection. Beside her stately
proportions, Ethel seemed to him ridiculously tiny and
insignificant, and her sparkling prettiness was altogether
eclipsed by Lesley's calmer beauty. He was not in an
amiable mood. He had steeled himself against the dictates
of his own taste and conscience, to encounter Caspar
Brooke's cold stare and freezing word of conventional welcome,
because he longed so intensely for a last word with
Lesley; but he was now almost sorry that he had come.<a name="Page_228"></a>
Lesley seemed utterly indifferent to his presence. She certainly
carried his flowers in her hand, but she did not
glance his way. On the contrary, she anxiously watched
the door from time to time, as if she awaited the coming of
some one who was slow to make his appearance. Who
could the person be for whom she looked? Oliver asked
himself jealously. He had not the slightest suspicion that
she was watching for Maurice Kenyon. And Maurice
Kenyon did not come.</p>

<p>It was his absence that, as the evening wore on, made
the color slip from Lesley's cheeks and robbed her eyes of
their first brightness. A certain listlessness came over her.
And Oliver, watching from his corner, exulted in his heart,
for he thought to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is for me she is looking sad; and if she will but yield
her will to mine, I will win and wear her yet, in spite of all
who would say me nay."</p>

<p>It was a veritable love-madness, such as had not come
upon him since the days of his youth. He had had a fairly
wide experience of love-making; but never had he been so
completely mastered by his passion as he was now. The
consideration that had once been so potent with him&mdash;love
of ease, money, and position&mdash;seemed all to have vanished
away. What mattered it that to abandon Ethel Kenyon
at the last moment would mean disgrace and perhaps even
beggary? He had no care left for thoughts like these. If
Lesley would acknowledge her love for him, he was ready
to throw all other considerations to the winds.</p>

<p>"Sing something, Lesley," her father said to her when
the evening was well advanced. "You have your music
here?"</p>

<p>Oh, yes, Lesley had her music here. But she glanced a
little nervously in Oliver's direction. "I wonder if Ethel
would accompany me," she said. She shrank nervously
from the thought of Oliver's accompaniments.</p>

<p>But Oliver was too quick for her. He moved forward
to the piano as soon as he saw Caspar Brooke's eye upon
it. And with his hand on the key-board, he addressed
himself suavely to Lesley.</p>

<p>"You are going to sing, I hope? May I not have the
pleasure of accompanying you?"</p>

<p>Lesley could not say him nay, but she also could not
help a glance, half of alarm, half of appeal, towards her<a name="Page_229"></a>
father. Mr. Brooke's face wore an expression which was
not often seen upon it at a social gathering. It was distinctly
stormy&mdash;there was a frown upon the brow, and an
ominous setting of the lips which more than one person in
the room remarked. "How savage Brooke looks!" one
guest murmured into another's ear. "Isn't he friendly with
Trent?" And the words were remembered in after days.</p>

<p>But nothing could be said or done to hinder Oliver from
taking his place at the piano, for Lesley did not openly
object, and her father could not interfere between her and
his own guest. So Lesley sang, and did not sing so well
as usual, for her heart failed her a little, partly through
vexation and partly through disappointment at Maurice
Kenyon's disappearance, but she gave pleasure to her
hearers, in spite of what seemed to herself a comparative
failure, and when she had finished her song, she was besieged
by requests that she would sing once more.</p>

<p>"Sing 'Thine is my heart,'" Oliver's soft voice murmured
in her ear.</p>

<p>"I have not that song here," said Lesley, quietly. She
was not very much discomposed now, but she did not want
to encourage his attention. She rose from the music-stool.
"My music is downstairs," she said. "I must go and
fetch it&mdash;I have a new song that Ethel has promised to
play for me."</p>

<p>Oliver bit his lips and stood back as Lesley escaped by
the door of the front drawing-room. Mr. Brooke's eye
was upon him, and he could not therefore follow her; but
he made his way into the library through the folding doors,
and there a new mode of attack became visible to him.
By the library door he gained the landing; and then he
softly descended the stairs, which were now almost deserted,
for the guests had crowded into the drawing-room, first to
hear Lesley's song and then to listen to a recitation by
Ethel Kenyon. But where had Lesley gone?</p>

<p>A subtle instinct told him that she had hidden herself for
a moment&mdash;and told him also where to find her. The
lights were burning low in her father's study, which had
been set to rights a little, in order to serve as a room where
people could lounge and talk if they wanted to escape the
din of conversation in the larger rooms. He looked in,
and at first thought it empty. But the movement of a curtain
revealed some one's presence; and as his eyes became<a name="Page_230"></a>
accustomed to the dimmer light, he saw that it was Lesley.
She was standing between the fireplace and curtained window,
and her hand was on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>She started when she saw him in the doorway. It was
her start that betrayed her. He came forward and shut
the door behind him&mdash;Lesley fancied that she heard the
click of the key in the lock. She tried to carry matters
with a high hand.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I cannot find my music here," she said,
"so please do not shut the door, Mr. Trent. There is little
enough light as it is."</p>

<p>She walked forward, but he had planted himself squarely
between her and the door. She could not pass.</p>

<p>"Mr. Trent&mdash;&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"Wait! don't speak," he said, in a voice so hoarse and
stifled that she could hardly recognize it as his own. "I
must have a word with you&mdash;forgive me&mdash;I won't detain
you long&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, I must go back to the drawing-room."</p>

<p>Lesley spoke civilly but coldly, though some sort of fear
of him passed shiveringly through her frame.</p>

<p>"You shall not go yet: you shall listen to what I have
to say."</p>

<p>"Mr. Trent!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is all very well to exclaim! You know what I
mean, and what I want. I had not time to speak the
other night; but I will speak now. Lesley, I love you!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Trent, Ethel is upstairs. Have you forgotten her?
Let me pass."</p>

<p>"I have not forgotten her: I remember her only too
well. She is the burden, the incubus of my life. Oh, I
know all that you can tell me about her: I know her
beauty, her gifts, her virtues; but all that does not charm
me. You, you and no other, are the woman that I love;
and, beside you, Ethel is nothing to me at all."</p>

<p>"You might at least remember your duty to her," said
Lesley, with severity. "You have won her heart, and you
are about to vow to make her happy. I cannot understand
how you can be so false to her."</p>

<p>"If I am false to her," said Oliver, pleadingly, "I am
true to the dictates of my own heart. Hear me, Lesley&mdash;pity
me! I have promised to marry a woman whom I do<a name="Page_231"></a>
not love. I acknowledge it frankly. I shall never make
her happy&mdash;strive as I may, her nature will never assimilate
with mine. She will go through life a disappointed
woman; while, if I set her free, she will find some man
whom she loves and will be happy with him. You may as
well confess that this is true. You may as well acknowledge
that her nature is too light, too trivial to be rent
asunder by any falsity of mine. Ethel will never break her
heart; but you might break yours, Lesley&mdash;and I&mdash;I also&mdash;have
a heart to break."</p>

<p>Lesley smiled scornfully. "Yours will not break very
easily," she said, "and I can answer for mine."</p>

<p>"You are strong," he said, using the formula by which
men know how to soften women's hearts, "stronger than
I am. Be merciful, Lesley! I am very weak, I know;
but weakness means suffering. Can you not pity me, when
you think that my weakness and my suffering come from
love of you?"</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, Mr. Trent, but I really cannot help it.
It is your own fault&mdash;not mine," said Lesley, a little hotly.
"I never thought of such a thing."</p>

<p>"No, you were as innocent and as good as you always
are," he broke in, "and you did not know what you were
doing when you led me on with those sweet looks and sweet
words of yours. I can believe that. But you did the
mischief, Lesley, without meaning it; and you must not
refuse to make amends. You made me think you loved
me."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no," said Lesley, her face aflame with outraged
modesty. "I never made you think so! You were mistaken&mdash;that
is all!"</p>

<p>"You made me think you loved me," Oliver repeated,
doggedly, "and you owe me amends. To say the very
least, you have given me great pain: you have made me the
most miserable of men, and wrecked all chance of happiness
between Ethel and myself&mdash;have you no heart that
you can refuse to repair a little of the harm that you have
done? You are a cruel woman&mdash;I could almost say a
wicked woman: hard, false, and cowardly; and I wish my
words could blight your life as your coquetry has blighted
mine."</p>

<p>Lesley trembled. No woman could listen to such words
unmoved, when her armor of incredulity fell from her as
Lesley's armor had fallen. Hitherto she had felt a scorn<a name="Page_232"></a>ful
disbelief in the reality of Oliver's love for her. But now
that disbelief had gone. There was a ring of passionate
feeling in Oliver's tones which could not be simulated. The
coldness, the artificiality of the man had disappeared: his
passion for Lesley had taken possession of him, and stirred
his nature to the very depths.</p>

<p>"Listen, Lesley," he said, in a low, strained voice, which
shook and vibrated with the intensity of his emotion, "don't
let me feel this. Don't let me feel that you have merely
played with me, and are ready to cast me off like an old
shoe when you are tired. Other women do that sort of
thing, but not you, my darling!&mdash;not you&mdash;don't let me
think it of you. Forgive me the harsh things I said, and
help me&mdash;help me&mdash;to forget them."</p>

<p>He had grasped the back of a chair with both hands, and
was kneeling with one knee on the <a name="tn_237"></a><!-- TN: Question mark changed to a period after "seat" and following letter capitalized-->seat. He now stretched
out his hands to her, and came forward as if to take her in
his arms. But Lesley drew back.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," she said, "but I cannot help it. I
did not mean to be unkind."</p>

<p>"If you are really sorry for me," he said, still in the
deep-shaken voice which moved her to so uneasy a sense
of pain and wrong-doing, "you will do all you can for me.
You will help me to begin a new life. I love you so much
that I am sure I could teach you to love me. I am certain
of it, Lesley&mdash;dearest&mdash;let me try!"</p>

<p>Did she falter for a moment? There flashed over her
the remembrance of Maurice's anger, of his continued
absence, of the probability that he would never come back
to her; and the dream of a tender love that could envelop
the rest of her lonely life assailed her like a temptation.
She hesitated, and in that moment's pause Oliver drew
nearer to her side.</p>

<p>"Kiss me, Lesley!" he whispered, and his head bent
over hers, his lips almost touched her own.</p>

<p>Then came the reaction&mdash;the awakening.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no! Do not touch me. Do not come near
me. I do not love you. And if I did"&mdash;said Lesley,
almost violently&mdash;"if I loved you more than all the world,
do you think that I would betray Ethel, my friend? that I
would be so false to her&mdash;and to myself?"</p>

<p>"Then you do love me?" he murmured, undisturbed by
her vehemence, which he did not think boded ill for his
chances, after all.<a name="Page_233"></a></p>

<p>"No, I do not."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken. Kiss me once, Lesley, and you will
know. You will feel your love then."</p>

<p>"You insult me, Mr. Trent. Love you? Come one step
nearer and I shall hate you. Oh!" she said, recoiling, as
a gleam from the lamp revealed to her the wild expression
in his eyes, the tension of his white lips and nostrils, the
strange transformation in those usually impassive features
which revealed the brutal nature below the polished surface
of the man, "I hate you now!"</p>

<p>She was close to the wall, and her head came in sudden
contact with the old-fashioned bell-rope. She seized it
firmly.</p>

<p>"Open the door," she said, "or I shall ring this bell
and send for my father. He will know what to do."</p>

<p>Oliver gazed at her for a minute or two, then, with a
smothered oath upon his lips, he turned slowly to the door
and opened it. Before leaving the room, however, he said,
in a voice half-stifled by impotent passion&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is this really your last word?"</p>

<p>"The last I shall ever speak to you," said Lesley, resolutely.</p>

<p>Then he went out, seizing his hat as he passed through
the hall and made his way into the street. He did not
notice, as he retired, that a woman's figure was only half-concealed
behind the curtains that screened a door in the
study, and that his interview with Lesley must therefore
have had an unseen auditor. He forgot that Ethel and
Rosalind waited for him above. He was mad with rage;
deaf to all voices saving those of passion: blind to all
sights save the visions that floated maddeningly before his
eyes.</p>

<p>Mad, blind, deaf to reason as he was, he was obliged to
come back to earth and its realities before very long. For
he was stopped in the streets by rough hands: a hoarse,
passionate voice uttered threats and curses in his ear; and
he found himself face to face with his long-vanished and
half-forgotten brother, Francis Trent.<a name="Page_234"></a></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">

<p class="chapterhead">BROTHERS.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">"What</span> do you want with me?" said Oliver trying to
shake off the rude grasp.</p>

<p>"I want you&mdash;you," gasped the man. He was evidently
much excited, and his breath came in hard, quick pants.
"Have you forgotten your own brother?"</p>

<p>The two paused for an instant under a gas lamp. Oliver
looked into Francis Trent's drawn, livid face&mdash;into the
wild, bloodshot eyes, and for an instant recoiled. It struck
him that the face was that of a madman. But it was,
nevertheless, the face of his brother, and after that momentary
pause he recovered himself and laughed slightly.</p>

<p>"Forgotten you? I'm not very likely to forget you, my
boy. Well, what do you want?"</p>

<p>"I want that two thousand pounds."</p>

<p>His hand still clutched Oliver's arm, and the grasp was
becoming unpleasant.</p>

<p>"Can you not take your hand off my arm?" said the
younger man, coolly. "I'm not going to run away. Apropos,
what have you been doing with yourself all these
weeks! I thought you had given us the slip altogether."</p>

<p>"I want my money," said Francis, doggedly.</p>

<p>Oliver looked at him curiously. What did this persistence
mean? What money was he thinking about?</p>

<p>"Your money?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes, my money&mdash;the money you ought to have given
me by this time&mdash;where is it?"</p>

<p>"You mean the sum I promised you on my wedding-day?"</p>

<p>Francis nodded, with a rather confused look upon his
face.</p>

<p>"My wedding-day has not occurred yet," said Oliver,
lightly. "Upon my word, I doubt whether it ever will
occur. Don't alarm yourself, Francis. I shall get the
money for you before long&mdash;I've not forgotten it."<a name="Page_235"></a></p>

<p>"I want it now. Two thousand pounds," said Francis,
thickly.</p>

<p>"Are you drunk, man! Do you think I carry two
thousand pounds about with me in my pocket? Go home&mdash;I'll
see you again when you are sober."</p>

<p>"I have touched nothing but water to-day," said his
brother. "I swear it&mdash;so help me, God! I know what
I'm about. And I know <i>you</i>. I know you for the vilest
cheat and trickster that ever walked the earth. I've been
in hospital&mdash;I don't know how long. I know that you
would cheat me if you could. You were to pay me within
six months&mdash;and it's over six months now."</p>

<p>"I tell you I'm not married. I was to pay you on my
wedding-day."</p>

<p>"You were to pay me within six months. Have you
opened a bank account for me and paid in the two thousand
pounds?"</p>

<p>"Are you mad, Francis?"</p>

<p>"Mad?&mdash;I may well be mad after all you have made me
suffer. I tell you I want money&mdash;money&mdash;money&mdash;I want
two thousand pounds."</p>

<p>His voice rose almost to a shriek, and the sound reverberated
along the quiet street with startling effect. Oliver
shrank into himself a little, and gave a hurried glance
around him. They were still in Upper Woburn Place, and
he was afraid that the noise should excite remark. It was
plain to him that Francis was either drunk or out of his
mind, and he therefore concentrated his attention on
getting quietly away from him, or leading him to some more
secluded spot.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, in a conciliatory tone. "You shall
have your money if you'll be quiet and come away with me.
Come to my house and I'll explain things to you. You've
not seen Rosalind for a long time, have you? Come in and
talk things over."</p>

<p>"Oh, you want to trap me, do you?" said Francis,
sullenly. "No, I'll not come to your house. Go in and
fetch the money out to me, or I'll make you repent it."</p>

<p>Oliver was almost at his wit's end.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, soothingly. "I will fetch it. I can
give you a cheque, you know. But don't you want a
little loose change to go on with? Take these."</p>

<p>He held out a handful of gold and silver. Francis looked
at it with covetous eyes for a minute or two, then thrust<a name="Page_236"></a>
his brother's hand aside with a jerk which almost sent the
coins into the road.</p>

<p>"I want justice, not charity," he said. "I want the
money you promised me."</p>

<p>Oliver shrugged his shoulders, and slowly returned the
money to his pocket.</p>

<p>"I am more than ever convinced that you are either
mad or drunk, my boy," he said. "You should never
refuse ten pounds when you can get it, and it's not a
thing that I should fancy you have often done before.
However, as you choose."</p>

<p>He walked onward, and Francis walked, heavily and
unsteadily, at his side, muttering to himself as he went.
Oliver glanced curiously at him from time to time.</p>

<p>"I wonder what <i>has</i> happened to him," he said to himself.
"It's not safe to question, but I <i>should</i> like to know.
Is it drink? or is it brain disease? One thing or the
other it must be. He does not look as if he would live to
spend the two thousand pounds&mdash;if ever he gets it. I
wonder if I could contrive to stave off the payment&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then he fell into a gloomy calculation of ways and
means, possibilities and chances, which lasted until the
house in Russell Square was reached. Here the brothers
paused, and Oliver looked keenly into his companion's face,
noting that a somewhat remarkable change had passed
over it. Instead of being flushed and swollen, as if from
drinking, it had become very pale. His eyes seemed on
the point of closing, and he wavered unsteadily in his
walk. Oliver had to put out his hand to save him from
falling, and to help him to the steps, where he collapsed
into a sitting posture, with his head against the railings.
He seemed to be stupefied, if not asleep.</p>

<p>"Dead drunk," said Oliver to himself. "The danger's
over for to-night, at any rate. Now, what shall I do with
him? I can't get him into the house and lock him into a
room&mdash;that would make talk. I think I had better leave
him to the tender mercies of the next policeman; if he gets
run in for being drunk and incapable, so much the better
for me."</p>

<p>He took out his latch key and let himself into the house,
closing the door softly behind him, so as not to awaken
the half-sleeping wretch upon the steps. Then he ascended
the stairs&mdash;still softly, as if he thought that he was not<a name="Page_237"></a>
yet out of danger of awaking him&mdash;and locked himself into
his own room. Then he drew a long breath, and stood
motionless for a moment, with bent brows and downcast
eyes. "There will be no end to this," he said to himself,
"until Francis is shipped off to America or landed safely in
a madhouse. One seems to me about as likely as another. I
wonder whether he was drunk to-night, or insane? Drunk,
I think: insanity"&mdash;with a sinister smile&mdash;"would be too
great a stroke of luck for me!"</p>

<p>But it was perfectly true, as Francis had said, that no
drop of intoxicating liquor had passed his lips that day.
He was suffering from brain disease, as Oliver had half
suspected, although not to such an extent that he could
actually be called insane. A certain form of mania was
gradually taking possession of his mind. He was convinced
that he had been robbed by his brother of much
that was his due; and that Oliver was even now withholding
money that was his. This fancy had its foundation in
fact, for Oliver had wronged him more than once, and was
ready to wrong him again should a suitable opportunity
occur; but the notion that at present occupied his mind,
respecting the payment of the two thousand pounds, was
largely a figment of his disordered brain. Oliver had certainly
questioned within himself whether he should be
called upon to pay this sum, and as Francis seemed to
have completely disappeared, he began to think that he
might evade his promise to do so; but he had not as yet
sought to free himself from the necessity of paying it.
Francis' own words and demeanor suggested this idea
for the first time to his mind. Was it possible, he asked
himself, to prove that Francis was insane&mdash;clap him into
a lunatic asylum&mdash;get rid of him forever without hush-money?
True, there was his wife, Mary, to be silenced;
but she had no influence and no friends. "Power is
always in the hands of those who have most money,"
Oliver said to himself, as he reviewed the situation, after
leaving Francis on the door step. "I have more money
than Francis, certainly: I ought to be able to control his
fate a little&mdash;and my own."</p>

<p>But Oliver, astute as he thought himself, was occasionally
mistaken in his conclusions. Francis Trent, as we
have said, was not intoxicated; and when he had dozed
quietly for a few moments on the door-step, he came some<a name="Page_238"></a>what
to himself, as he usually did after these fits of frenzy.
He felt dazed and bewildered, but he was no longer furious.
He could not remember very well what he had said to
Oliver, or what Oliver had said to him. But he knew where
he was, and that in this region&mdash;between Russell Square
and St. Pancras Church&mdash;he should find his truest friends
and perhaps also his bitterest foes.</p>

<p>He roused himself, stretched his cramped limbs, and
turned back to wander towards Upper Woburn Place, hardly
knowing, however, why he bent his steps in that direction.
Instinct, not memory or reflection, guided him, and when he
halted, he leaned against the railings of the house from
which he had seen Oliver come forth, without realizing
for one moment that it was the house in which his faithful
and half-forgotten Mary was to be found.</p>

<p>The door opened, as he waited, and some of the guests
came out. Two or three carriages drove up: there was a
call for a hansom, a whistle, and an answering shout. Francis
Trent watched the proceedings with a sort of stupid
attention. They reminded him of the previous night when
he had seen Ethel Kenyon coming out of the theatre after
her farewell performance. But on that occasion he had
passed unnoticed and unrecognized. This was not now to
be the case.</p>

<p>Suddenly a woman on the threshold of Mr. Brooke's house
caught sight of the weary, shabby figure leaning against the
railings. Francis heard a little gasp, a little cry, and felt
a hand upon his own. "Francis! is it you? have you really
come back?" It was Mary Kingston who looked him in
the face.</p>

<p>He returned the gaze with lack-lustre, unseeing eyes.
When the fever-fit of rage left him, he was still subject to
odd lapses of memory. One of these had assailed him
now. He did not recognize his wife in the very least.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know you," he said. "Go away, woman.
I'm not doing any harm."</p>

<p>There is nothing so piteous as the absence of recognition
of the patient's best friends in cases of brain-disease. Francis
Trent's condition sent a stab of pain to Mary's innermost
heart. She forgot where she was&mdash;she forgot her duties as
doorkeeper; she remembered only that she loved this man,
and that he had forgotten her. She cried aloud&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Francis, I am your wife."<a name="Page_239"></a></p>

<p>"I have no wife," said the distraught man, looking listlessly
beyond her. "I am here to see Oliver&mdash;he is to
give me some money."</p>

<p>"Don't you remember Mary, Francis? Look at me&mdash;look
at me."</p>

<p>"Mary?" he said, doubtfully. "Oh, yes, I remember
Mary. But you are not Mary, are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed I am. Where have you been all this time?
Oh, my poor dear, you can't tell me! You are ill, Francis.
Let me take care of you. Can you tell me where you
live?"</p>

<p>But he could not reply. His head drooped upon his
breast: he looked as if he neither saw nor heard. What
was she to do?</p>

<p>Of one thing Mary was certain. Now that she had found
her husband, she was not going to lose sight of him again.</p>

<p>She would go with him whithersoever he went, unless he
repelled her by force. She gave one regretful thought to
her young mistress, and to a certain project which she had
determined to put into effect that night, and then she
thought of the Brookes no more. She must leave them, and
follow her husband's fortunes. There was no other way
for her.</p>

<p>Fortunately she had money in her pocket. She had also
thrown a shawl across her arm before she came to the door.
The shawl belonged to Miss Brooke, and had been offered to
one of the guests as a loan; but Mary had forgotten all about
the guests, and appropriated the shawl, with the cool resolution
which characterized her in cases of emergency. Necessity&mdash;especially
the necessity entailed by love&mdash;knows
no law. At that moment she knew no law but that of her
repressed and stunted, but always abiding, affection for the
husband who had burdened her life for many weary years
with toil and anxiety and care. For him she would do anything&mdash;throw
up all friendships, sacrifice her future, her
character, and, if need be, her life.</p>

<p>She wrapped the shawl round her head, and put her arm
through her husband's, without once looking back.</p>

<p>"Come, Francis," she said, quietly, "show me where
you live now. We will go home."</p>

<p>She led him unresistingly away. For a little while he
walked as if in a dream; but by and by his movements
became more assured, and he turned so decidedly in one<a name="Page_240"></a>
direction that she saw he knew his way and was pursuing
it. She said nothing, but kept close to his side, with her
hand resting lightly on his arm. She was not mistaken in
her expectations. Francis went straight to the wretched
lodging in which he had slept for the past few nights, and
Mary at once assumed the management of his affairs.</p>

<p>She was rewarded&mdash;as she thought, poor soul!&mdash;for her
efforts. When she had lighted a fire and a candle, and
prepared some sort of frugal meal for the man she loved,
he lifted up his face and looked at her with a gleam of
returning memory and intelligence in his haggard eyes.</p>

<p>"Mary," he said, in a bewildered tone, "Mary&mdash;my
wife? How did you come here, Mary? How did you find
me out?"</p>

<p>"Are you glad to see me, dear?" said Mary.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes, I am. Everything will be right now. You'll
manage things for me."</p>

<p>It was an acknowledgment of the power of her affection
which more than recompensed her for the trouble of the
last few months.<a name="Page_241"></a></p>

<p class="chapterhead">MRS. TRENT'S STORY.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">"I never</span> heard of such an extraordinary thing," said Lesley.</p>

<p>"Then that shows how little you know of the world,"
said Doctor Sophy, amicably. "I've heard of a hundred
cases of the kind."</p>

<p>"Well, there are some elements of oddity in this case,"
remarked Caspar Brooke, striking in with unexpected
readiness to defend his daughter's views. "Kingston was
not a giddy young girl, who would go off with any man
who made love to her. Indeed, I can't quite fancy any
man making love to her at all. She was remarkably plain,
poor woman."</p>

<p>"She had beautiful eyes," said Lesley. "And she was
so nice and quiet and kind. And I really thought that she
was&mdash;fond of me." She paused before she uttered the last
three words, being a little afraid that they would be thought
sentimental. And indeed Miss Brooke did give a contemptuous
snort, but Caspar smiled kindly, and patted his
daughter's hand.</p>

<p>"Don't take it to heart," he said. "'Fondness' is a
very indeterminate term, and one that you must not scrutinize
too closely. This little black beast, for instance"&mdash;caressing,
as he spoke, the head of the ebony-hued cat
which sat upon the arm of his chair&mdash;"which I picked up
half-starving in the street when it was a kitten, is fond of
me because I feed it: but suppose that I were too poor to
give it milk and chicken-bones, do you think it would retain
any affection for me? A sublimated cupboard-love is all
that we can expect now-a-days from cats&mdash;and servants."</p>

<p>"When you can write as you do about love," said Lesley,
who was coming to know her father well enough to tease
him now and then, "I wonder that you dare venture to
express yourself in this cold-blooded way in our hearing!"<a name="Page_242"></a></p>

<p>"Ah, but, my dear, I was not talking about love," said
Caspar, lightly. "I was talking about 'fondness,' which
is a very different matter. You did not say that your maid,
Kingston, <i>loved</i> you&mdash;I suppose she was hardly likely to go
that length&mdash;you said that she was fond of you. Very
probably. But fondness has its limits."</p>

<p>Lesley smiled in reply, and did not utter the thought
that occurred to her. What she really believed was that
Kingston was not only "fond" of her, after the instinctive
fashion of a dumb creature that one feeds, but loved her,
as one woman loves another. Although her democratic
feelings came to her through her father's teaching, or by
inheritance from him, she did not quite like to say this to
him: he might think it foolish to believe that a servant
whom she had not known for very many weeks actually
loved her; and yet she had the conviction that Kingston's
attachment was deeper and more sincere than that of many
a woman who claimed to be her friend. And she was both
grieved and puzzled by Kingston's disappearance.</p>

<p>For this was on Monday morning, and the woman had
not come back to Mr. Brooke's. Great had been the astonishment
of every one in the house when it was found
that the quiet, well-spoken, well-behaved Mary Kingston,
who had hitherto proved herself so trustworthy and so conscientious,
had gone away&mdash;disappeared utterly and entirely,
without leaving a word of explanation behind. She
had last been seen on the pavement, shortly before midnight,
assisting a lady to get into a hansom. Nobody had
seen her re-enter the house. It seemed as if she had been
spirited away. She had gone without a bonnet or shawl,
in her plain black dress and white cap and apron, as if she
meant to return in a minute or two, and she had not
appeared again. The shawl that she had taken with her
was not missed, for Miss Brooke continued for some time
under the impression that it had been lent to one of the
visitors.</p>

<p>The conversation recorded above took place at Mr.
Brooke's luncheon-table. It was not often that he was
present at this meal, but on this occasion he had joined his
sister and daughter, and questioned <a name="tn_247"></a><!-- TN: "then" changed to "them"-->them with considerable
interest about Kingston. After lunch, he put his hand
gently on Lesley's arm, just as she was leaving the dining-room,
and said, in a tone where sympathy was veiled with
banter<a name="Page_243"></a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never mind, my dear. We will get you another maid,
who will be <i>less</i> fond of you, and then perhaps she will
stay."</p>

<p>"I don't want another maid, thank you, papa. And,
indeed, I do think Kingston was fond of me," said Lesley
earnestly.</p>

<p>Mr. Brooke shrugged his shoulders. "Verily," he said,
"the credulity of some women&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it isn't credulity," said Lesley, with something
between a smile and a sigh, "it is faith. And I can't
altogether disbelieve in poor Kingston&mdash;even now."</p>

<p>Mr. Brooke shook his head, but made no rejoinder.
Privately he thought Lesley foolishly mistaken, but believed
that time would do its usual office in correcting the mistakes
of the young.</p>

<p>His own incredulity received a considerable shock somewhat
later in the day. About four o'clock a knock came
to his study, and the knock was followed by the appearance
of the sour-visaged Sarah.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir, there's that woman herself wants to
see you."</p>

<p>"What woman, Sarah?" said Caspar, carelessly. He
was writing and smoking, and did not look up from his
work.</p>

<p>"The woman, Kingston, that ran away," said Sarah, indignantly.
"I nearly shut the door in her face, sir, I
did."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't have been legal," said Mr. Brooke.
"Why doesn't she see Miss Brooke or Miss Lesley? I am
busy."</p>

<p>"I expect she thinks she can get round you more easy,"
said Sarah, who was a very old servant, and occasionally
took liberties with her master and mistress.</p>

<p>"She won't do that, Sarah," said Caspar, laughing a little
in spite of himself. "Show her in."</p>

<p>He laid down his pen and his pipe with a rather weary
air. Really, he was becoming involved in no end of domestic
worries, and with few compensations for his trouble!
Such was his silent thought. Lesley would, shortly leave
him: Alice had refused to come back to his house. Well, it
would be but for a short time. He had almost made up his
mind that when Lesley was gone he would give up a house
altogether, establish his sister in a flat, throw journalism<a name="Page_244"></a>
to the winds, and go abroad. The life that he had led so
long, the life of London offices and streets, of the study and
the committee-room, had become distasteful to him. As he
thrust away from him the manuscript at which he had been
busy, his lips were, half unconsciously, murmuring a very
well-worn quotation&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="firstline">"For I will see before I die,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The palms and temples of the South."<br></span>
</div>

<p>And from this passing day-dream he was roused by the
entrance of a woman whom he knew only as his daughter's
maid.</p>

<p>He was struck at once by some indefinable change that
had passed over her since he had seen her last. He had
noticed her, as he noticed everybody that came within his
ken; and he had remarked the mechanical precision of
her demeanor, the dull sadness of her lifeless eyes. There
was a light in her face now, a tremulous quiver of her lips,
a slight color in her thin cheeks. She looked like a creature
who could feel and think: not an automaton, worked by
ingenious machinery.</p>

<p>He noted the change, but did not estimate it at its true
worth. He thought she was simply excited by the consciousness
of her misdemeanor, and by the prospect of an
interview with him. He put on his most magisterial
manner as he spoke to her.</p>

<p>"Well, Kingston," he said, "I hope you have come to
explain the cause of the great inconvenience you have
brought upon Miss Brooke and my daughter."</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I have come to do, sir," said
Kingston, looking him full in the face, and speaking in
clear, decided tones, such as he had never heard from her
before. She generally spoke in a muffled sort of way, as
though she did not care to exert herself&mdash;as though she
did not want her true voice to be heard.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Mr. Brooke, more kindly. He had
the true gentleman's instinct; he could not bear to see a
woman stand while he was seated, although she was only
his daughter's maid, and&mdash;presumably&mdash;a culprit awaiting
condemnation. "Now tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir, I'd prefer to stand," said Kingston,
quietly. "At any rate, until I've told you one or two<a name="Page_245"></a>
things about myself. To begin with: my name was Kingston
before my marriage, but it's not Kingston now."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you have got married since Saturday?"
asked Caspar, quietly.</p>

<p>The woman uttered a short, gasping sort of laugh.
"Since Saturday? Oh, no, sir. I've been married for the
last six years, or more. I am Francis Trent's wife&mdash;Francis
the brother of Mr. Oliver Trent, who was here
last Saturday night."</p>

<p>And then, overcome with her confession, or with the
look of mute astonishment&mdash;which he could not repress&mdash;on
Caspar Brooke's countenance, she dropped into the
chair that he had offered her, covered her face with her
hands and sobbed aloud. It took her hearer some seconds
before he could adjust his mind to this new revelation.</p>

<p>"Do you mean," he said at last, "that brother of Mr.
Trent's"&mdash;he had nearly said "of Mrs. Romaine's"&mdash;"who&mdash;who&mdash;&mdash;" He
paused, feeling unable to put into words
the question that was in his mind.</p>

<p>"That got into trouble some years ago, you mean," said
Mrs. Trent, lifting her face from her hands, and trying to
control her trembling voice. "Yes, I mean him. I know
all about the story. He got into trouble, and he's gone
from bad to worse ever since. I've done my best for him,
but it doesn't seem as if I could do much more now."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He's been ill&mdash;I think he's had an accident&mdash;but I
don't rightly know what's been the matter with him. Mr.
Brooke, sir, I hope you'll believe me in what I say. When
I came here first I didn't know that you were friends with
his sister and his brother, or I wouldn't have come near
the place. And when I found it out I'd got fond of Miss
Lesley, and thought it would be no harm to stay."</p>

<p>"But what&mdash;what on earth&mdash;made you take a situation
as ladies'-maid at all?" cried Caspar, pulling his beard in
his perplexity, as he listened to her story.</p>

<p>"I wanted to earn money. <i>He</i> could not work&mdash;and I
could not bear to see him want."</p>

<p>"<i>Could</i> not work? Was it not a matter of the will?
He could have worked if he had wished to work," said Mr.
Brooke, rather sternly. "That Francis Trent should let
his wife go out as&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, it was work I was used to," said Francis
Trent's wife, patiently. "I'd been in service when I was<a name="Page_246"></a>
a girl, and knew something about it. And it was honest
work. There's plenty of ways of earning money which
are worse than being a servant in your house, and to Miss
Lesley, too."</p>

<p>Lesley's words came back to Caspar's mind. She had
had "faith" in Kingston's attachment, and her faith seemed
now to be justified. Women's instincts, as Caspar acknowledged
to himself, are in some ways certainly juster than
those of men.</p>

<p>"Is he not strong? Is there no sort of work that he can
do?" he demanded, with asperity. "If you had come to
me at the beginning and told me who you were, I might
have found something for him. It is not right that his wife
should be waiting upon my daughter. Tell me what he can
do."</p>

<p>"I don't think he can do much now," was Mary Trent's
answer. "He's very much broken down. I daresay you
wouldn't know him if you saw him. I don't think he <i>could</i>
do a day's work, so there's all the more reason that I
should work for both."</p>

<p>She spoke truly enough as regarded the present; but,
by a suppression of the truth which was almost heroic she
concealed the fact that for many years Francis had been
able but unwilling to work. Now, certainly, he was incapacitated,
and she spoke as if he had been an invalid for
years. Thus Caspar Brooke understood her, and his next
words were uttered in a gentler tone.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry that you should have been brought
into these straits, Mrs. Trent. Will you give me your
address, and let me think over the matter? Mrs. Romaine
or Mr. Oliver Trent&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd rather not have anything to do with them," said
Mrs. Trent, quietly, but with an involuntary lifting of her
head. "Mrs. Romaine knows I am his wife, but she won't
speak to me or see me." Caspar moved uneasily in his
chair. This account of Rosalind's behavior did not coincide
with his own idea of her softness and gentleness.
"And Oliver Trent is the man who has brought more
misery on me than any other man in the world."</p>

<p>"But if I promise&mdash;as I will do&mdash;not to give your address
to Mrs. Romaine or Mr. Trent, will you not let me know
where you live?" said Caspar, with the gentle intonation
that had often won him his way in spite of greater
obstacles than poor Mary Trent's obstinate will.<a name="Page_247"></a></p>

<p>She gave him her address, after a little hesitation. It
was in a Whitechapel slum. Then, seeing in his face that
he would have liked to ask more questions, she went on
hurriedly&mdash;</p>

<p>"But I have not come here to take up your time. I
only wanted to explain to you why I left your house on
Saturday&mdash;which I'm very sorry to have been obliged to
do. And one other thing&mdash;but I'll tell you that afterwards."</p>

<p>"Well? Why did you go on Saturday, Mrs. Trent?"
said Mr. Brooke, more curious than he would have liked
to allow. But she did not reply as directly to his question
as he wanted her to do.</p>

<p>"I was only a poor girl when Francis married me," she
said, "but I loved him as true as any one could have loved,
and I would have worked my fingers to the bone for him.
And he was good to me, in his way. He got to depend
upon me and trust to me; and I used to feel&mdash;especially
when he'd had a little more than he ought to have&mdash;as if
he was more of a child to me than a husband. It was to
provide for him that I came here. And then&mdash;one day
when I'd been here a little while&mdash;I went to his lodgings
to give him some money I'd been saving up for him&mdash;and
I found him gone&mdash;gone&mdash;without a word&mdash;without a
message&mdash;disappeared, so to speak, and me left behind to
be miserable."</p>

<p>Caspar ejaculated "Scoundrel!" behind his hand, but
Mrs. Trent heard and caught up the word.</p>

<p>"No, you're wrong, sir, he was no scoundrel," she said
calmly. "He'd met with an accident and been taken to
an hospital. He was there for weeks and weeks, not able
to give an account of himself, or, as far as I can make out,
even to give his name. He came out last week, and made
his way, by sort of instinct, to your house, where he knew
I was living. I came out on the steps and saw him there&mdash;my
husband that I'd given up for lost. I ran up to him&mdash;you'd
have done the same in my place&mdash;and went with
him without thinking of anybody else."</p>

<p>"I see. But why did you not leave a word of explanation
<a name="tn_252"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "behind."-->behind."</p>

<p>"I daren't quit hold of him for a moment, sir. He was
so dazed and stupid, he didn't even know me at the first.
That was why I say it was instinct, not knowledge, that
guided him to the place. If I had left him to speak to<a name="Page_248"></a>
any one in the house, he might have gone off, and I never
seen him again. That was why I felt obliged to go sir,
and am very sorry for the inconvenience I know I must
have caused."</p>

<p>Caspar nodded gravely. "I see," he said. "Of course
it <i>was</i> inconvenient, and we were anxious&mdash;there's no
denying that. But I can see the matter from your point
of view. Would you like to see Miss Lesley and explain
it to her?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather leave it in your hands, sir," said Mary Trent.
"Because there's one thing more I've got to mention before
I go. And Miss Lesley may not thank me for mentioning
it, although I do it to save her&mdash;poor lamb&mdash;and to save
you too, sir, from a great trouble and sorrow and disgrace
that hangs over you all just now."</p>

<p>Caspar flushed. "Disgrace?" he said, almost angrily.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Trent looked at him full in the face and
nodded gravely, as she answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, disgrace."<a name="Page_249"></a></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">"A FAIRLY GOOD REASON."</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Caspar Brooke's</span> attitude stiffened. His features and
limbs became suddenly rigid.</p>

<p>"I must confess, Mrs. Trent," he said, "that I am unable
to conceive the possibility of <i>disgrace</i> hanging over me
or mine."</p>

<p>"That is because you are a man, and therefore blind to
what goes on around you," said Mary Trent, with sudden
bitterness; "and I am a woman, and can use my eyes and
ears. There, I'd better tell you my tale at once, and you
can make what you like of it. Miss Lesley&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you have anything to say about Miss Lesley, it had
better be said in her hearing," returned Caspar, in hot
displeasure. He rose and laid his hand upon the bell. "I
want no tales about her behind her back."</p>

<p>"For mercy's sake, sir, stop," said the woman, eagerly.
"It is only to spare her that I ask it! It isn't that she is
to blame&mdash;no, no, I don't mean that; but she is in more
danger than she knows."</p>

<p>Caspar's hand fell from the bell rope. His face had
turned a trifle pale, and his brows looked very stern.</p>

<p>"Tell me exactly what you mean. I do not wish to listen
to anything that Miss Lesley has not intended me to hear.
I have perfect faith in her."</p>

<p>"Faith in her! She's one of the sweetest and truest-hearted
ladies I ever came across," said Mary Trent,
indignantly; "but she may be on the brink of a precipice
without knowing it. Sir, what I mean is this. Mr. Oliver
Trent is in love with Miss Lesley, and is doing his best to
get her to run off with him. Yes, I know what you want
to say&mdash;that she would never do such a thing&mdash;but one cannot
always say what a girl will do under pressure; and,
believe me or not as you please, Oliver Trent is ready to
throw over Miss Kenyon at any moment for the sake of
your daughter, Mr. Brooke."<a name="Page_250"></a></p>

<p>"Do you know what you are saying?" thundered Caspar,
now white to the lips. "Do you know what an aspersion
you are casting on my daughter's character? Are you
aware that Miss Kenyon's marriage with Mr. Trent is to
take place to-morrow morning? Your remarks are perfectly
unjustifiable&mdash;unless you are in ignorance of the facts
of the case."</p>

<p>"I know all, and yet I warn you," said Mrs. Trent, perfectly
unmoved by this burst of anger. "I tell you what I
have seen and heard for myself. And I know Oliver Trent
only too well. It was Oliver Trent who betrayed my only
sister, and brought her to a miserable death. She was a
good girl until she met him. He ruined her, and he had
no scruples. He will have more outward respect to Miss
Lesley and Miss Kenyon, but he is no more scrupulous
about using his power, when he has any, than he was
then."</p>

<p>"After making this accusation you must not be surprised
if I ask what grounds you have for it," said Mr. Brooke.</p>

<p>He was calm enough to all appearance now, but even
Mrs. Trent, not very observant by nature, could tell that
he was very much disturbed. For answer, she proceeded
to describe the scene that had taken place in the very
room in which they now stood, on the preceding Saturday
night.</p>

<p>"I saw him follow Miss Lesley into this room," she explained.
"And I'd seen enough to make me fearful of
what he was going to do or say. You know there are folding-doors
between this room and the next&mdash;screened by curtains.
The doors had been partly opened, and I slipped
into the space between them. I was covered by the curtain,
and I could not hear all that was said, because I had sounds
from the other room in my ears as well; but I heard a
great deal, and I made up my mind to tell you there and
then. If I had not seen my husband that night you would
have heard my story before you slept."</p>

<p>Caspar Brooke's next question took her by surprise. He
swung round on one heel, so that his back was almost
turned to her, and flung the words over his shoulder with
savage bitterness.</p>

<p>"What business had you to listen to my daughter's conversation
with her friends?"</p>

<p>This was a distinctly ungrateful speech, and Mrs. Trent
felt it so. But she replied, quietly<a name="Page_251"></a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Lesley's been kinder to me than any one I ever
knew. And I had suffered a good deal from Oliver Trent's
wicked falseness. He is my brother-in-law, as the law puts
it, and I don't want to have any quarrel with him: but he
shall do no more harm than I can help."</p>

<p>By the time she had finished her speech Caspar had
recovered himself a little.</p>

<p>"You are quite right," he said, "and you have done me
a service for which I thank you. I don't for a moment
suppose that my daughter is not capable of taking care of
herself. But other people are interested beside Lesley.
Miss Kenyon's brother is one of my closest friends, and I
should be very treacherous if I allowed her to marry this
man, Oliver Trent, after all that I have heard about him to-night&mdash;if
it be true. I don't want to throw doubt on your
testimony, Mrs. Trent, but I suppose I must have some
further proof."</p>

<p>"Miss Lesley could tell you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall not ask Miss Lesley, unless I am obliged. Did
you not yourself beg me to spare her? This other story of
his heartless conduct to your sister is quite enough to
damn him in every right-minded woman's eyes. I shall
speak to him myself&mdash;I will have the truth from his own lips
if I have to wring it out by main force," said Caspar speaking
more to himself than to Mary Trent, and quite unaware
how truculent an appearance he presented at that moment
to that quiet woman's eyes.</p>

<p>She smiled stealthily to herself. She had a great faith in
Caspar Brooke's powers for good or evil. To have him
upon her side made her support with equanimity the
thought that she and Francis might suffer if Oliver did not
marry a rich wife. <i>He</i> would see that they did not want. And
she should behold the darling wish of her heart gratified
at last. For had she not ardently desired, ever since the
day of Alice's betrayal and Alice's death, to see that false
betrayer punished? Caspar Brooke would punish him,
and she should be the instrument through which his punishment
had come about.</p>

<p>"I should like to thrash the scoundrel within an inch of
his life," said Mr. Brooke.</p>

<p>"There is very little time before the wedding, if you
mean to do anything before then," said Mrs. Trent, softly.</p>

<p>Caspar started. "Yes, that is true. I must see him
to-night. H'm"&mdash;he stopped short, oppressed by the dif<a name="Page_252"></a>ficulties
of the situation. Had he not better speak to
Maurice Kenyon at once? But, as he recollected, Maurice
had gone out of town, and would not be back until half an
hour or so before the hour fixed for his sister's wedding.
The ceremony was to be performed at an unusually early
hour&mdash;ten o'clock in the morning&mdash;for divers reasons: one
being that Ethel wanted to begin her journey to Paris in
very good time. She had never been anxious for a fashionable
wedding, and had decided to have no formal wedding
breakfast, and there was no reason for delaying
the proceedings until a later hour. But, as Mr. Brooke
reflected, unless he went to Ethel Kenyon herself there
was little time in which to take action. Indeed, it seemed
to him for a moment almost better to let the past sink into
oblivion, and to hope that Oliver would be kind and faithful
to the beautiful and gifted girl who was, apparently, the
choice of his heart.</p>

<p>But it was not to Mrs. Trent's interest that this mood
should last. "Poor Miss Kenyon!" she said, in quietly
regretful tones. "I'm sorry for her, poor young lady. No
mother or father to look after her, and no friend even who
dares to tell her the truth!"</p>

<p>The words stung Caspar. He thought of his own daughter
Lesley, placed in Ethel's position, and he felt that he
could not let Ethel go unwarned. And yet&mdash;could he
believe Oliver Trent to be such a scoundrel on the mere
strength of this woman's story! It might be all a baseless
slander, fabricated for the sake of obtaining money. And
there was so little time before poor Ethel's wedding!</p>

<p>While he hesitated, Mary Trent saw her opportunity,
and seized it.</p>

<p>"If you want to see Oliver Trent," she said, "he is
coming to our lodgings this very night. I have been to
Mrs. Romaine's house to ask him to come to my husband
who wants a few words with him. If you'll undertake to
come there, I'll let you see what sort of a man Mr. Oliver
Trent is, and then you can judge for yourself whether or no
he is a fit husband for Miss Kenyon, or a fit lover for Miss
Lesley Brooke."</p>

<p>Caspar raised his hand hastily as if to entreat silence.
"Tell me where you live," he said shortly, "and the hour
when he will be there."</p>

<p>"Half-past nine o'clock this evening, sir. The place&mdash;oh,
you know the place well enough: it is in Whitechapel."<a name="Page_253"></a></p>

<p>She gave him the address. He cast a keen, sharp glance
at her face as he took it down. "Not a pleasant neighborhood,"
he said gravely. "May I ask why you have taken
a room in that locality?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I did not take it," she said. "My
husband took it before I found him, and I was obliged to
stay. Francis is ill&mdash;I cannot get him away."</p>

<p>"Can I do anything to help&mdash;&mdash;" Caspar was beginning
but she interrupted him with almost surprising vehemence.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no. I would not take anything from you. I
did not come for that. I came to see if I could save Miss
Lesley and Miss Kenyon from misery, not to beg&mdash;either
for myself or him."</p>

<p>The earnestness of her tone took from Mr. Brooke a certain
uneasy suspicion which had begun to steal over him:
a suspicion that she was using him as a tool for her own
ends, that her real motives had been concealed from him.
Even when she had gone&mdash;and she went without making
any attempt to see Lesley or Miss Brooke&mdash;he could not
rid himself altogether of this suggestion; for with her sad
voice no longer echoing in his ears, with her deep-set eyes
looking no longer into his face, he found it easier to doubt
and to suspect than to place implicit faith in the story that
she had told him.</p>

<p>Lesley had heard of Kingston's reappearance, and was
very much surprised to find that she was not called upon to
interview her runaway attendant. Still more was she surprised
when at last she heard the front door shut, and
learned from Sarah that the woman had gone without a
word. So much amazed was she, that shortly before dinner
she stole into her father's study and attempted to cross-examine
him, though with small result.</p>

<p>"Father, Sarah says that Kingston has been to see you."</p>

<p>"Yes, she has," said Caspar, briefly. He was writing
away as if for dear life, with his left hand grasping his
beard, and his pipe lying unfilled upon the table&mdash;two signs
of dire haste, as Lesley had by this time learned to know.
She remained silent, therefore, feeling herself an intruder.</p>

<p>"What do you want to know, my dear?" said her father
at last, in a quiet, business-like tone. He went on writing
all the time.</p>

<p>"Is she coming back to us?"</p>

<p>"No."<a name="Page_254"></a></p>

<p>"Why did she go away?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you just now. She had a&mdash;a&mdash;fairly good
reason."</p>

<p>"I thought she must have had that," said Lesley, brightening.
"And did she come here to explain?"</p>

<p>"Partly."</p>

<p>"But why not to us?"</p>

<p>Caspar laid down his pen suddenly, and laughed. "Oh,
the insatiable curiosity of women! I thought you were
wiser than most, Lesley, but you have all the characteristics
of your sex. I can't satisfy your curiosity, to-day, but I
will, if I can, in a short time. Will that do?"</p>

<p>Lesley seemed rather hurt. "I don't think I asked
questions out of mere curiosity," she said. "I always
liked Kingston."</p>

<p>"And she likes you, my dear&mdash;so far you were perfectly
right," said her father, rising, and patting her on the arm.
"To use your feminine parlance, she is quite as 'fond' of
you as you can reasonably desire."</p>

<p>"I don't like to hear so much about 'feminine' ways and
characteristics," said Lesley, smiling, and recovering her
spirits. "I always fancy somebody has vexed you when
you talk in that cynical manner."</p>

<p>"That remark is creditable to your penetration," said
Mr. Brooke, in his accustomed tone of gentle raillery, "and,
you cannot say that it is not a very harmless way of letting
off steam."</p>

<p>"Who has vexed you <a name="tn_259"></a><!-- TN: Quotation mark added after "then?"-->then?" said Lesley, looking keenly
into his face. It was a bold question, but her father did
not look displeased.</p>

<p>"Suppose I said&mdash;you yourself?" he queried, with a
certain real gravity which she was not slow to discover.</p>

<p>The color rushed into her face. She thought of Maurice
Kenyon, and the mistake that he had made. She had long
been conscious of her father's disappointment, but had not
expected him to speak of it. She made an effort to be
equal to the situation.</p>

<p>"If you are vexed with me, it would be kinder to tell me
of it than to sneer at all womankind in general," she said,
with spirit.</p>

<p>"Right you are, my girl. Well&mdash;why have you refused
Kenyon?"</p>

<p>Her eyes drooped. "I would rather you did not ask me
that, father."<a name="Page_255"></a></p>

<p>"Nonsense, Lesley. A plain answer to a plain question
is easy to give. Are you in love with any one else?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," she answered, vehemently; "I am not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then, for some inexplicable reason, she stopped
short.</p>

<p>"'Not in love with any one' was what she was going to
say," said Caspar to himself, as he watched with keen eyes
the changes of color and expression in her face. "And she
does not dare to say it after all. What does that mean?"
But he did not say this aloud.</p>

<p>"You don't care for Maurice, then?" he asked her.</p>

<p>She drew herself away from him and colored hotly, but
made no other reply.</p>

<p>"My dear," said Caspar, half jestingly, half warningly,
"you must let me remind you that silence is usually taken
to mean consent."</p>

<p>And even then she did not speak.</p>

<p>"Really, of all incomprehensible creatures, women are
the worst. Well, well! Tell me this, at any rate, Lesley:
you have not given your heart to Oliver Trent?"</p>

<p>"Father! how can you ask?"</p>

<p>"Have you anything to complain of with respect to
him? Has he always behaved to you with courtesy and
consideration?"</p>

<p>"I would rather not say," Lesley answered, bravely.
"He&mdash;spoke as I did not like&mdash;once&mdash;or twice; but it is
his wedding-day to-morrow, and I mean to forget it all."</p>

<p>"Once or twice! When was the last time, child? On
Saturday? Here in this room? Ah, I see the truth in
your face. Never mind how I know it. I want to know
nothing more. Now you can go: I am busy, and shall
probably have to be out late to-night."</p>

<p>With these words he led the girl gently out of the room,
kissed her on the forehead before he shut the door, and then
returned to his work. He did not dine with his sister and
daughter, but sent a message of excuse. Later in the
evening, Sarah reported to Miss Brooke that "Master had
gone out, looking very much upset about something or
other; and he'd taken his overcoat and his big stick, which
showed, she supposed, that he was off to the slums he was
so fond of." Sarah did not approve of slums.<a name="Page_256"></a></p>

<p class="chapterhead">ETHEL KENYON'S WEDDING-DAY.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> morning of Ethel Kenyon's wedding-day was as
bright and sunny as any wedding day had need to be.
The weather was unusually warm, and the trees were already
showing the thin veil of green which is one of
spring's first heralds in smoky London town. The window-boxes
in the Square were gay with hyacinth and crocus-blossom.
The flower-girls' baskets were brilliant with
"market bunches" of wall-flowers and daffodils&mdash;these being
the signs by which the dwellers in the streets know that
the winter is over, that the time of the singing of birds has
come, and that the voice of the turtle is heard in the land.
The soft breezes blew a fragrance of violets and lilac-blossom
from the gardens and the parks. London scarcely
looked like itself, with the veil of smoke lifted away, and a
fair blue sky, flecked with light silvery cloud, showing
above the chimney-tops.</p>

<p>Ethel was up at seven o'clock, busying herself with the
last touches to her packing and the consideration of her
toilet; for she was much too active-minded to care for the
seclusion in which brides sometimes preserve themselves
upon their wedding-mornings. Some people might have
thought that it would not be a very festive day, for her
brother was the only near relative who remained to her,
and an ancient uncle and aunt who had been, as Ethel
herself phrased it, "routed out" for the occasion, were
not likely to add much to the gaiety of nations by their
presence. Mrs. Durant, lately Ethel's companion, was to
remain in the house as Maurice's housekeeper, and she
had nominally the control of everything; but Ethel was
still the veritable manager of the day's arrangements. She
had insisted on having her own way in all respects, and
Oliver was not the man to say her nay&mdash;just then.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine had offered to stay the night with her,
and help her to dress; but Ethel had smilingly refused<a name="Page_257"></a>
the companionship of her future sister-in-law. "Thanks
very much," she had said, in the light and airy way which
took the sting out of words that might otherwise have hurt
their hearer; "but I don't think there's anything in which
I want help, and Lesley Brooke is going to act as my maid
on the eventful morn itself."</p>

<p>"Lesley Brooke?" said Mrs. Romaine. She could not
altogether keep the astonishment out of her voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, why not?" asked Ethel, with just so much defiance
in her voice as to put Mrs. Romaine considerably on
her guard. "Have you any objection?"</p>

<p>"Dear Ethel, how can you ask such a thing? When
you know how fond I am of Lesley."</p>

<p>"Are you?" asked Miss Kenyon lightly. "Do you
know I should never have thought it, somehow. <i>I</i> am
exceedingly fond of Lesley, and so"&mdash;with a little more
color in her face than usual&mdash;"so is Oliver."</p>

<p>Bravely as she spoke, there was something in the accent
which told of effort and repression. Mrs. Romaine admired
her for that little piece of acting more than she had
ever admired her upon the stage. She was too anxious
for her brother's prosperity to say a word to disturb Ethel's
serenity, whether it was real or assumed.</p>

<p>"I am so glad, dear," she said, sweetly. "Lesley is a
dear girl, and thoroughly good and loving. I am quite
sure you could not have a better friend, and she will be
delighted to do anything she can for you."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said Ethel, with a little pout.
"I had a great deal of trouble to get her to promise to
come. She made all sorts of excuses&mdash;one would have
thought that she did not want to see me married at all."</p>

<p>Which, Rosalind thought, might be very true. She had
so strong a faith in the power of her brother's fascinations
that she could not believe that he had actually "made
love," as he had threatened, to Lesley Brooke without
success.</p>

<p>Ethel spoke truly when she said that she had had great
difficulty in persuading Lesley to come. After what had
passed between herself and Oliver, Lesley felt herself a
traitress in Ethel's presence. It seemed to her at first
impossible to talk to Ethel about her pretty wedding gifts,
her trousseau and her wedding tour, or to listen while she
swore fidelity to Oliver Trent, when she knew what she<a name="Page_258"></a>
did know concerning the bridegroom's faith and honor.
On the Sunday after the Brookes' evening party she had a
very severe headache, and sent word to Ethel that she
could not possibly come to her on the morrow. But Ethel
immediately came over to see her, and poured forth questions,
consolations, and laments in such profusion that
Lesley, half blind and dazed, was fain to get rid of her by
promising again that nothing should keep her away. And
on Monday the headache had gone, and she had no excuse.
It was not in Lesley's nature to simulate: she could not
pretend that she had an illness when she was perfectly
well. There was absolutely no reason that she could give
either to the Kenyons or to Miss Brooke for not keeping
her promise to sleep at Ethel's house on the Monday
night, and be present at her wedding on Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>So she wound herself up to make the best it. It seemed
to her that no girl had ever been placed in so painful a
position before. We, who have more experience of life than
Lesley had, know better than that. Lesley's position was
painful indeed, but it might in many ways have been worse.
But she, ignorant of real life, more ignorant even than most
girls, because she knew so few of the pictures of real life
that are to be found in the best kind of novels, had nothing
but her native instincts of truth and courage to fall back
upon, together with the strong will and power of judgment
that she inherited from her father. These qualities, however,
stood her in good stead that day. "It is no use to
be weak," she said to herself. "What good shall I do to
Ethel if I give her cause to suspect Oliver Trent's truth to
her? The only question is&mdash;ought I to tell her&mdash;to put
her on her guard? Oh, I think not&mdash;I hope not. If he
marries her, he cannot help loving her; and it would break
her heart&mdash;now&mdash;if I told her that he was not faithful. I
must be brave and go to her, and be as sympathetic as usual&mdash;take
pleasure in her pleasure, and try to forget the past!
but I wish she were going to marry a man that one could
trust, like my father, or like&mdash;Maurice."</p>

<p>She always called him Maurice when she thought about
him now.</p>

<p>It took all the strength that she possessed, however, to go
through the ordeal of those hours with Ethel. She managed
to keep away until nearly nine o'clock on Monday night,
and then&mdash;just after her father had gone out&mdash;she received<a name="Page_259"></a>
a peremptory little note from Ethel. "Why don't you
come? You said you would come almost directly after
dinner, and it is ever so late now. Oliver has just left me:
he has business in the city, so I shall not see him again
until to-morrow. Do come at once, or I shall begin to
feel lonely."</p>

<p>So Lesley went.</p>

<p>She had to look at the wedding-cake, the wedding-gown,
the simple little breakfast table. She sat up with Ethel
until two in the morning, helping her to pack up her things,
and listening to her praises of Oliver. That was the worst
of it. Ethel <i>would</i> talk of Oliver, <i>would</i> descant on his
perfections, and, above all, on his love for her. It was
very natural talk on Ethel's part, but it was indescribably
painful and humiliating to Lesley. Every moment of silence
seemed to her like an implicit lie, and yet she could not
bring herself to destroy the fine edifice of her friend's hopes,
although she knew she could bring it down to the ground
with a touch&mdash;a word.</p>

<p>"And I am so glad there is not to be a fuss," Ethel said
at last, when St. Pancras' clock was striking two: "for I
always thought that a fussy wedding would be horrid. You
see, Lesley, I have dressed up so often in white satin and
lace, as a bride, or a girl in a ballroom, or some other
character not my own, that I feel now as if there would be
no reality for me in a wedding if I did not wear rather
every-day clothes. In a bride's conventional dress, I should
only fancy myself on the stage again."</p>

<p>"You don't call the dress you are to wear to-morrow
'every-day clothes,' do you?" said Lesley, with a smiling
glance towards the lovely gown in which Ethel had elected
to be married, and then to wear during the first part of her
wedding-journey.</p>

<p>"I call it just a nice, pretty frock&mdash;nothing else," said
Ethel, complacently, "one that I can pay calls in afterwards.
But I could not refuse the lovely lace Maurice insisted
on giving me: so I shall wear a veil instead of a bonnet&mdash;it
is the only concession I make to conventionality."</p>

<p>"I wish you would go to sleep, Ethel: you will look
very pale under your veil to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Well, I will try; but I don't feel like it. I hope Maurice
will be back in good time. It was very tiresome of
that patient of his to send for him in such a hurry."<a name="Page_260"></a></p>

<p>Then there was a silence, for both girls were growing
sleepy; and it was with a yawn that Ethel at last inquired&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lesley, why won't your father come to my wedding?"</p>

<p>"Won't he?" said Lesley, with a little <a name="tn_265"></a><!-- TN: Period added after "start"-->start.</p>

<p>"Not he: I asked him again on Saturday, and he refused."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Lesley, not very steadily, "it gives him
pain to be present at a wedding: he speaks sometimes&mdash;as
if he did not like to hear of them."</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor, dear thing, I had forgotten all that trouble,"
said Ethel, giving her friend a hug which nearly
strangled her; "but won't it come right in the end?
Captain Duchesne says that she is so sweet, so charming&mdash;and
your father is just delightful."</p>

<p>"I think I can't talk about it," said Lesley, very quietly.</p>

<p>"Then we won't. Did you know I had asked Captain
Duchesne to the breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ethel, how heartless of you!" Lesley said, laughing
in spite of herself. For Captain Duchesne's devotion
was patent to all the world.</p>

<p>At last they slept in each other's arms; but at seven
o'clock Ethel was skimming about the room like a busy
fairy, and it was Lesley, sleeping heavily after two or three
wakeful nights, who had to be aroused by the little bride-elect,
and Ethel laughed merrily to see her friend's start of
surprise.</p>

<p>"Ethel! Ethel! People should be waiting on you and
here you are bringing me tea and bread and butter. This is
too bad!"</p>

<p>"It's a new departure," Ethel laughed. "There is no
law against a bride's making herself useful as well as ornamental,
is there? You will have to hurry up, all the same,
Lesley: we are dreadfully late already. And it is the loveliest
morning you ever saw&mdash;and the bouquets have just
come from the florist&mdash;and everything is charming! I feel
as if I could dance."</p>

<p>But Ethel's mirth did not communicate itself to Lesley.
There was nothing forced or unnatural in the young
bride's happiness, but Lesley felt as if some cloud, some
shadow, were in the air. Perhaps she had had bad dreams.
She would not damp Ethel's spirits by a word of warning,
but the old aunt from the country who came to inspect her<a name="Page_261"></a>
niece as soon as she was dressed for church was not so
considerate.</p>

<p>"You are letting your spirits run away with you, my
dear," she said, reprovingly. "Even on a wedding-day
there should not be too much laughter. Tears before
night, when there has been laughter before breakfast,
remember the proverb says."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a cheerful old lady!" said Ethel, brimming
over with saucy laughter once more, as soon as the old
dame's back was turned. "I don't care: I don't mean to
be anything but a smiling bride&mdash;Oliver says that he hates
tears at a wedding, and I don't mean him to see any."</p>

<p>Maurice arrived just in time to dress and to escort his
sister to the church. It was not he, but Mrs. Durant, the
companion and house-keeper, who first received a word of
warning that things were not altogether as they should be.
Others beside Lesley were scenting calamity in the air.
Mrs. Romaine was to form one of the wedding-party. She
made her appearance at a quarter to ten, beautifully dressed,
but white to the very lips, and with a haggard look about
her eyes. As soon as she entered the house she drew
Mrs. Durant aside.</p>

<p>"Has Oliver been sleeping here?" she asked.</p>

<p>"<i>Here!</i>" Mrs. Durant's indignant accent was sufficient
answer.</p>

<p>"He has not been home all night," Mrs. Romaine whispered.</p>

<p>"Not at home!"</p>

<p>"I suppose he is sleeping at his club and will come on
from there," Mrs. Romaine answered, trying to reassure herself
now that she had given the alarm to another. "Everything
has been ordered&mdash;my bouquet came from him, at
least from the florist's this morning&mdash;and I suppose we
shall find him at the church. But I have been dreadfully
anxious about him&mdash;quite foolishly, I daresay. Don't say
anything to any body else."</p>

<p>Mrs. Durant did not mean to say anything, but&mdash;without
exactly stating facts&mdash;she had managed in about three
minutes to convey her own and Mrs. Romaine's feeling of
discomfort, to the whole party. The only exceptions were
Maurice and Ethel, who, of course, heard nothing. A gloom
fell upon the guests even while the carriages were standing
at the door.<a name="Page_262"></a></p>

<p>Lesley and Mrs. Romaine happened to be placed in the
same carriage, facing one another. They looked at one
another in silence, but with a mutual understanding that
they had never felt before. Each read her own fear in the
other's face. But the fear came from different sources.
Lesley was afraid that Oliver had felt himself unable to
fulfil his engagement to Ethel, and had therefore severed
his connection with her by flight: Rosalind feared that he
had been taken ill or met with some untoward accident.
Only in Rosalind's mind there was always another fear in
the <a name="tn_267"></a><!--TN: "back ground" changed to "background"-->background where her brothers were concerned&mdash;that
one or other of them would be bringing himself and her to
disaster and disgrace. She had no faith in them, and not
much faith in herself.</p>

<p>There was no bridegroom in waiting at St. Pancras'
Church. Mrs. Romaine held a hurried consultation with a
friend, and a messenger was despatched to Oliver's club,
where he sometimes slept, and also to the rooms which he
called his "chambers" in the city. A little silence overspread
the group of guests from the Kenyons' house. Other
visitors, of whom there were not many, looked blithe
enough; but gloom was plainly visible on the faces of the
bride's friends. And a little whisper soon ran from group
to group&mdash;"The bridegroom has not come."</p>

<p>If only he would appear before the bride! There was
yet time. The carriage containing Ethel and her brother
had not started from the door. But the distance was short,
and speedily traversed: still Oliver did not come. And
there at last was the wedding-chariot with its white silk
linings and the white favors on the horses&mdash;and there was
the pretty, smiling bride herself upon her brother's arm.
How sweet she looked as she mounted the broad grey
steps, with cheeks a little rosy, eyes downcast, and her
smiles half concealed by the costly lace in which she had
veiled herself! There was never a prettier bride than
Ethel Kenyon, although she had not attired herself in all
the bridal finery that many women covet.</p>

<p>Something in the expression of the faces that met her at
the church door startled her a little when she first looked
up: she changed color, and glanced wonderingly from
one to another. Some one spoke in Maurice Kenyon's ear.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked, quickly. "Is anything
wrong?"<a name="Page_263"></a></p>

<p>"Oliver is late, dear, that is all. Just wait a minute&mdash;here
by the door: he will be here presently."</p>

<p>"Late!" re-echoed the girl, turning suddenly pale.
"Oh Maurice, what do you mean? <i>We</i> were late too&mdash;it
is a quarter past ten."</p>

<p>"Hush, my darling, he will be here directly, and more
distressed than any of us, no doubt."</p>

<p>"I should think so," said Ethel, trying to laugh. "Poor
Oliver! what a state he will be in!"</p>

<p>But the hand with which she had suddenly clutched
Lesley's arm trembled, and her lips were very white.</p>

<p>For a minute, for five, for ten minutes, the bridal party
waited, but Oliver did not come. A messenger came back
to say that he had not been at the club since the previous
day. And then Maurice's hot temper blazed up. He left
his sister and spoke to his old friend, Miss Brooke.</p>

<p>"Do not let Ethel make herself a laughing-stock," he
said. "The man insults us by being late, and shall account
to me for it, but she must be got out of this somehow.
Can't you take her away?"</p>

<p>"Let her go to the vestry," said Miss Brooke. "You
had better not take her away just yet&mdash;look at the crowd
outside. I will get Lesley to persuade her."</p>

<p>Ethel made no opposition. She went quietly into the
vestry and sat down on a seat that was offered to her,
waiting in silence, asking no questions. Then there was a
short period of whispered consultation, of terrible suspense.
She herself did not know whether the time was short or long.
She could not bear even Lesley's arm about her, or the support
of Maurice's brotherly hand. Harry Duchesne's dark
face in the background seemed in some inexplicable sort of
way the worst of all. For she knew that he loved and
admired her, and she was shamed by a recreant lover before
his very eyes.</p>

<p>After a time Maurice was called out. A policeman in
plain clothes wanted to speak to him. They had five
minutes' conversation together, and then the young doctor
returned to the room where Ethel was still sitting. His
face was as white as that of his sister now, and she was
the first to remark the change.</p>

<p>"You have heard something," she said, springing to her
feet and fixing her great dark eyes upon his face.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ethel, my poor darling, yes. Come home with
me."<a name="Page_264"></a></p>

<p>"Not till you tell me the truth."</p>

<p>"Not here, my darling&mdash;wait till we get home. Come
at once."</p>

<p>"I must know, Maurice: I cannot bear to wait. Is he&mdash;is
he&mdash;<i>dead</i>?"</p>

<p>He would gladly have refused to answer, but his pallid
lips spoke for him. And from another group a shriek rang
out from the lips of Rosalind Romaine&mdash;a shriek that told
her all.</p>

<p>"Dead? Murdered? Oh, no, no&mdash;it cannot be?" cried
Oliver's sister. "Not dead! not dead!"</p>

<p>She fell back in violent hysterics, but Ethel neither wept
nor cried aloud. She stood erect, her head a little higher
than usual, a smile that might almost be called proud curving
her soft lips.</p>

<p>"You see," she said, unsteadily, but very clearly; "you
see&mdash;it was not his fault. He <i>would</i> have come&mdash;if he
had been&mdash;alive."</p>

<p>And, then, still smiling, she gave her hand to her brother
and let him lead her away. But before she had crossed
the threshold of the room, he was obliged to take her in
his arms to save her from falling, and it was in his arms
that she was carried back to the carriage which she had
left so smilingly.</p>

<p>But for those who were left behind there was more bad
news to hear. In London no secret can be kept even from
the ears of those whose heart it breaks to hear it. Before
noon the newsboys were crying in the streets&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brutal murder of a gentleman on his wedding-day.
Arrest of a well-known journalist."</p>

<p>And everywhere the name bandied from pillar to post
was that of Mr. Caspar Brooke, who had been arrested
on suspicion of having caused the death of Oliver Trent.<a name="Page_265"></a></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">IN ETHEL'S ROOM.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">To</span> those who knew Caspar Brooke best, it seemed ridiculously
impossible that he should have been accused of any
act of violence. But the accusation was made with so
much circumstantial detail that no course seemed open to
the police but to arrest him with as little delay as possible.
And before the ill-fated wedding party had been dispersed,
before Miss Brooke could hurry home, and long before
Lesley suspected the blow that was in store for her, he had
been taken by two policemen in plain clothes to the Bow
Street Police station.</p>

<p>The full extent of the misfortune did not burst upon
Doctor Sophy all at once. When she left the church the
accusation was not publicly known, and as she walked home
she reflected on the account that she must give to her brother
of the extraordinary events of the day. She wished he
had been present, and wondered why he had shirked the
invitation which had been sent him by Ethel. He was not
usually out of bed at this hour, but she resolved to go to
his room and tell him the story at once, for, though he had
never cared much for poor Oliver Trent, he had always
been fond of Ethel. Lesley had gone to the Kenyons'
house at Maurice's earnest request, and might not be back
for some time.</p>

<p>She opened the door with her latch-key, and, to her great
surprise, was confronted at once by Sarah, her face swollen,
and her eyes red with weeping.</p>

<p>"Sarah! why&mdash;have you heard the dreadful news already?"
said Miss Brooke.</p>

<p>"Have <i>you</i> heard it, is more the question, I'm thinking?"
said Sarah, grimly.</p>

<p>"Of course you mean&mdash;about poor Mr. <a name="tn_270"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "Trent?"-->Trent?"</p>

<p>"More than that, ma'am. However, here's a letter from
master to you, and that'll tell you more than I can do."
And Sarah, handed a note to her mistress, and retired to
the back of the hall, sniffing audibly.<a name="Page_266"></a></p>

<p>Miss Brooke walked into the dining-room and opened
the note. Caspar had gone out, she gathered from the
fact of his having written to her at all: perhaps he had
heard of Oliver Trent's death, and had gone to offer his
services to Maurice, or to assist in discovering the murderer.
So she thought to herself; and then she began to read the
note.</p>

<p>In another minute Sarah heard a strange, muffled cry;
and running into the room found that Miss Brooke had
sunk down on the sofa, and was trembling in every limb.
Her brother's letter was crushed within her hand.</p>

<p>"What does it mean, Sarah?&mdash;what does it mean?"
she stammered, with a face so white and eyes so terror-stricken
that Sarah took her to task at once.</p>

<p>"It means a great, big lie, ma'am, that's all it means.
Why, you ain't going to be put about by that, I hope, when
master himself says&mdash;as he said to me&mdash;that he'd be home
afore night! I'm ashamed of you, looking as pale as you
do, and you a doctor and all!"</p>

<p>"Did he say to you he would be home before night?"
said Miss Brooke collecting herself a little, but still looking
very white.</p>

<p>Sarah took a step nearer to her, and spoke in a low voice.
"Nobody else in the house knows where he's gone," she
said, "but I know, for master called me himself, and told
me what they wanted him for. It was two men in plain
clothes, and there was a cab outside and a p'liceman on
the box. 'Of course it's all a mistake, Sarah,' he said to
me, as light-hearted as you please, 'and don't let Miss
Lesley or your Missus be anxious. I dare say I shall be
back in an hour or two.' And then he asked the men if he
might write a note, and they let him, though they read it
as he wrote, the nasty wretches!"&mdash;and Sarah snorted
contemptuously, while she wiped away a tear from her left
eye with her apron.</p>

<p>"But it is so extraordinary&mdash;so ridiculous!" said Miss
Brooke. And then, with a little more color in her face, she
read her brother's letter over again.</p>

<p>It consisted only of these words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sophy</span>,&mdash;Don't worry yourself. The police have got it into
their wise heads that I had something to do with poor Trent's tragic
end. I dare say I shall be back soon, but I must go and hear what
they've got to say. Take care of Lesley&mdash;C. B."</p></div><a name="Page_267"></a>

<p>"Take care of Lesley! As if <i>she</i> wanted taking care
of!" said Miss Brooke, with sudden energy. "Sarah, go
over at once to Mr. Kenyon's, and tell Miss Lesley to come
home. She can't stay <i>there</i> while this is going on. It isn't
decent."</p>

<p>Sarah was rather glad to execute this order. She was of
opinion that Miss Lesley needed to be taken down a bit,
and that this was the way in which the Lord saw fit to do
it. And it never occurred to Miss Brooke to caution the
woman against startling Lesley or hurting her feelings.
She had been startled certainly, and almost overcome; but
she belonged to that class of middle-aged women who think
that their emotions must necessarily be stronger than those
of young people, because they are older and understand
what sorrow means, whereas the reverse is usually the case.
Besides, Miss Brooke quite underrated the warmth of Lesley's
attachment to her father, and was not prepared to see
her experience anything but shallow and commonplace
regret.</p>

<p>So Sarah went to the house opposite and knocked at the
door. She had to knock twice before the door was
opened, for the whole household was out of joint. The
maids were desperately clearing away all signs of festivity&mdash;flowers,
wedding-cake, the charming little breakfast that
had been prepared for the guests&mdash;everything that told of
wedding preparation, and had now such a ghastly look.
Under Mrs. Durant's direction the servants were endeavoring
to restore to the rooms their wonted appearance.
Ethel's trunks had been piled into an empty room: she
would not want her trousseau now, poor child. The uncle
from the country was pacing up and down the deserted
drawing-room; the aunt was fussing about Ethel's dressing-room,
nervously folding up articles of clothing and putting
away trifles. All the blinds were down, as if for a funeral.
And in Ethel's own room, the girl lay on her bed, white
and rigid as a corpse, with half-shut eyes that did not seem
to see, and fingers so tightly closed that the nails almost
ran into her soft palms. Since she had been laid there she
had not spoken; no one could quite tell whether she
were conscious or not; but Lesley, who sat beside her,
and sometimes laid her cheek softly against the desolate
young bride's cold face, or kissed the ashen-grey lips,
divined by instinct that she was not unconscious although<a name="Page_268"></a>
stunned by the force of the blow&mdash;that she was thinking,
thinking, thinking all the time&mdash;thinking of her lost lover, of
her lost happiness, and beating herself passionately against
the wall of darkness which had arisen between her and
the future that she had planned for herself and Oliver.</p>

<p>Sarah asked at once for Miss Lesley Brooke, and Mrs.
Durant came out of the dining-room to speak to the messenger.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Brooke wanted very particularly?" she asked.
"Miss Kenyon will not have anyone else with her."</p>

<p>"I think I must speak to Miss Lesley, ma'am; my mistress
said I must," said Sarah, primly. Then, forgetting
her loyalty to her employers in her desire to be communicative,
she went on&mdash;"Maybe you haven't heard what's
happened, ma'am. Mr. Brooke's been taken up on the
charge of murder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>This was not strictly true, but it was the way in which
Sarah read the facts.</p>

<p>"And Miss Brooke says Miss Lesley <i>must</i> come home, as
it is not proper for her to stay."</p>

<p>The horror depicted on Mrs. Durant's face was quite as
great as Sarah had anticipated, and even more so. For
Mrs. Durant, a conventional and narrow-minded woman,
did not know enough of Caspar Brooke's character to feel
any indignation at the accusation: indeed, she was the sort
of woman who was likely to put a vulgar construction upon
his motives, and regard it as probable that he had quarreled
with Oliver for not wishing to marry Lesley instead of
Ethel Kenyon. And she at once grasped the situation.
Under the circumstances&mdash;if Caspar Brooke had killed
Ethel's lover&mdash;it was most improper that Caspar Brooke's
daughter should be staying in the house.</p>

<p>"Of course!" she said, with a shocked face. "Miss
Lesley Brooke must go at once&mdash;naturally. How very
terrible! I am much obliged to Miss Brooke for sending&mdash;as
Ethel's chaperon I couldn't undertake&mdash;&mdash;I'll go
upstairs and send her down to you."</p>

<p>Sarah was left in the hall, while Mrs. Durant went upstairs.
But after a time the lady came down with a troubled
air.</p>

<p>"I can't get her to come," she said. "You must go up
yourself, Sarah, and speak to her. She will come into the
dressing-room, she says, for a minute, but she cannot leave<a name="Page_269"></a>
Miss Kenyon for a longer time. You must tell her quietly
what has happened, and then she will no doubt see the
advisability of going away."</p>

<p>Sarah went upstairs, therefore, and entered the dressing-room,
where the old aunt was still busy; and in a minute
or two Lesley appeared.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she said, briefly.</p>

<p>"Your aunt sent me to say you must come home at
once, miss."</p>

<p>"I cannot come just yet: Miss Kenyon wishes me to
stay with her," said Lesley, with dignity.</p>

<p>"You'd better come, Miss Lesley. I don't want to tell
you the dreadful news just now: you'd better hear it at
home. Then you'll be glad you came. It's your pa,
miss."</p>

<p>"My father! Oh, Sarah, what do you mean? Is he ill?
is he dead? What is it?"</p>

<p>"He's been arrested, miss, for killing Mr. Trent."</p>

<p>Sarah spoke in a whisper, but it seemed to her hearers
as if she had shouted the words at the top of her voice.
Mrs. Durant pressed her hands together and uttered a
little scream. Lesley turned deadly white, and laid one
hand on the back of a chair, as if for support. And the
old aunt immediately ran into the inner room, and burst
into tears over Ethel's almost inanimate form, bewailing
her, and calling her a poor, injured, heartbroken girl, until
Ethel opened her great dark eyes, and fixed them upon the
aged, distorted face with a questioning look.</p>

<p>"Lesley!" she breathed. "I want Lesley."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dearest child, you must do without Lesley
now. It is not fit that she should come to you."</p>

<p>But Ethel's lips again formed the same sounds: "I want
Lesley." And the old lady continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"She must not come, dear: you cannot see Lesley
Brooke again. It is her father who has done this terrible
thing&mdash;blighted your life&mdash;destroyed your happiness&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And so she would have babbled on had not Ethel all at
once raised herself in her bed, with white face and flaming
eyes, and called in tones as clear and resonant as ever&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lesley! Lesley! come back!"</p>

<p>And then the old aunt was silent: silent and amazed.</p>

<p>From the next room Lesley came, softly and swiftly as
was her wont. Her face was pale, but her eyes and lips<a name="Page_270"></a>
were steady. She went straight to Ethel; was at once
encircled by the girl's arms, and drew Ethel's head down
upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Shall I go?" she whispered in Ethel's ear.</p>

<p>"No, no; don't leave me."</p>

<p>"You know what they say? Can you trust my father?"</p>

<p>"I trust you both. Stay with me."</p>

<p>Lesley raised her head and looked back at the little
group of meddlesome women who had tried to tear her
from her friend's side. At the look they disappeared.
They dared not say another word after meeting the rebuke
conveyed in Lesley's pale, set face and resolute eyes. They
closed the door behind them, and left the two girls alone.</p>

<p>For a long time neither spoke. Ethel seemed to have
relapsed once more into a semi-unconscious state. Lesley
sat motionless, pillowing her friend's head against her
shoulder, and stroking one of her hands with her own.
Now and then hot tears welled over and dropped upon
Ethel's dark, curly head, but Lesley did not try to wipe them
away. She scarcely knew that she was crying: she was
only aware of a great weight of trouble that had come
upon her&mdash;trouble that seemed to include in its effects all
that she held most dear. Trouble not only to her friend,
but to her father, her mother, her lover. Not a shadow of
doubt as to her father's innocence rested upon her mind:
there was no perplexity, no shame&mdash;only sorrow and
anxiety. Not many women could have borne the strain
of utter silence with such a burden laid on them to bear.
But to Lesley, even in that hour, Ethel's trouble was
greater than her own.</p>

<p>An hour must have passed away before Ethel murmured,</p>

<p>"Lesley&mdash;are you there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am with you, darling: I am here."</p>

<p>"You are crying."</p>

<p>"I am crying for you, Ethel, dear."</p>

<p>For the first time, Ethel's hand answered to her pressure.
After a little silence, she spoke again&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish I could die&mdash;too."</p>

<p>"My poor little Ethel."</p>

<p>"I suppose there is no chance of that. People&mdash;like
me&mdash;don't die. They only suffer&mdash;and suffer&mdash;and break
their hearts&mdash;and live till they are eighty. Oh, if you
were kind to me, you would give me something to make
me die."<a name="Page_271"></a></p>

<p>She shuddered, and crept a little closer to Lesley's
bosom. "Oh, why must he go&mdash;without me&mdash;without
me?" she cried. And then she burst out suddenly into
bitter weeping, and with Lesley's arms about her she wept
away some of the "perilous stuff" of misery which had
seemed likely to destroy the balance of her brain. When
those tears came her reason was saved, and Lesley was
wise enough to be reassured and not alarmed by them.</p>

<p>She was very much exhausted when the burst of tears
was over, and Lesley was allowed to feed her with strong
soup, which she took submissively from her friend. "You
won't go?" she whispered, when the meal was done. And
Lesley whispered back: "I will not go, darling, so long
as you want me here."</p>

<p>"I want you&mdash;always." Then with a gleam of returning
strength and memory: "What was it they said about your
father?"</p>

<p>Lesley shivered.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Ethel, dear," she said.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I know&mdash;I remember. That he was&mdash;a&mdash;oh, I
can't say the word. But that is not true."</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> it is not true. It is a foolish, cruel mistake."</p>

<p>"It could not be true," Ethel murmured. "He was
always kind and good. Tell him&mdash;from me&mdash;that I don't
believe it, Lesley. And don't let them take you away
from me."</p>

<p>Holding Lesley's hand in hers, at last she fell asleep;
and sleep was the very thing that was likely to restore her.
The doctor came and went, forbidding the household to
disturb the quiet of the sick-room; and after a time,
Lesley, exhausted by the excitements and anxieties of the
day, laid her head on the pillow and also slept. It was
late in the afternoon when Maurice Kenyon, stealing softly
into the room, found the two heads close together on
one pillow, the arms interlaced, the slumber of one as
deep as of the other. His eyes filled with tears as he
looked at the sleeping figures. "Poor girls!" he muttered
to himself. "Well for them if they can sleep; but
I fear that theirs will be a sad awakening."</p>

<p>Suddenly Lesley opened her eyes. The color rushed
to her pale cheeks as she saw who was regarding her, but
she had sufficient self-control not to start or move too
hastily. Ethel altered her position at that moment, and<a name="Page_272"></a>
left Lesley free to rise, then sank back to slumber. And,
obeying a silent motion of Maurice Kenyon's hand, Lesley
followed him noiselessly into the dressing-room.<a name="Page_273"></a></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">THE EVIDENCE.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">"She</span> ought not to be left alone: I promised not to leave
her," said Lesley in a low tone.</p>

<p>"I have brought a nurse with me. She can go in and
sit by the bed until you are ready to return," said Maurice,
quietly. "Call us, nurse, if my sister wakes and asks for
us; but be very careful not to disturb her unnecessarily."</p>

<p>The nurse, whose face Lesley scanned with involuntary
interest, was gentle and sensible-looking, with kindly eyes
and a strong, well-shaped mouth. She looked like a woman
to be trusted; and Lesley was therefore not sorry to see
her pass into Ethel's room. She had felt very conscious
of her own ignorance of nursing during the past few hours,
and had not much confidence in the sense or judgment of
any woman in the house. Maurice made her sit down,
and then stood looking at her for a moment.</p>

<p>"You are terribly pale," he said at last. "Will you
come downstairs and let me give you something to eat and
drink?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, thank you. I want nothing. And Ethel may
need me: I cannot bear to be far away."</p>

<p>"Have you had nothing all day? It is after five o'clock."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Then you must eat before I talk to you. I have several
things to say, and you must have strength to listen. Sit
still: I will be back directly."</p>

<p>He went away, and Lesley leaned back in her chair and
closed her eyes. She was very weary, but even in her
trouble there was some sweetness for her in the knowledge
that Maurice was attending to her needs. When he returned
with wine and food, she roused herself to accept both,
knowing very well that he would not tell her what she
wanted to hear until she had done his bidding. The door
between bed and dressing room was closed; the house was
very quiet, and the light was dim. Maurice spoke at last,
in grave, low tones.<a name="Page_274"></a></p>

<p>"I have just come from your father," he said.
Lesley started and clasped her hands. "Is he at home
again?"</p>

<p>"No. They would not let him go. But take heart&mdash;we,
who know him, will stand by him until he is a free
man."</p>

<p>"Then you believe&mdash;as I believe?" she asked, tremulously.</p>

<p>"Would it be possible for me to do otherwise? Hasn't
he been my friend for many a year? You have surely no
need to ask!"</p>

<p>Lesley, looking up at him, stretched out her hand in
silence. He took it in both his own and kissed it tenderly.
Seeing her grief, and seeing also her sympathy for another
woman who grieved, had, for the time being, cured him of
his anger against her. He had cherished some bitter
feeling towards her for a while; but he forgot it now.</p>

<p>"I am as sure," he said, fervently, "that Caspar Brooke
could not commit murder as I am sure that <i>you</i> could not.
It is an absurdity to think of it."</p>

<p>"Then what has made people think of it?" asked
Lesley. "How has it come about?"</p>

<p>Maurice paused. "There is a mystery somewhere," he
said slowly, "which is a little difficult to fathom. Can
you bear to hear the details? Your father told me to tell
them to you&mdash;as gently as I could."</p>

<p>"Tell me all&mdash;all, please."</p>

<p>"Poor Oliver Trent was found dead early this morning
on the stair of a lodging-house in Whitechapel. I have
been to the place myself: it is now under the care of the
police. He had been beaten about the head ... it
was very horrible ... with a thick oaken staff or
walking stick ... the stick lay beside him, covered
with blood, where he was found. The stick was&mdash;was your
father's, unfortunately: it must have been stolen by some
ruffian for the purpose&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short, as if the story were too hard to tell.
Lesley sat watching his face, which was as pale as her own.</p>

<p>"Go on," she said, quickly. "What else?"</p>

<p>"A pocket-book&mdash;with gilt letters on the back: C. B.
distinctly marked. That was also found on the stairs, as
if it had dropped from the pocket of some man as he went
down. And it is proved&mdash;indeed, your father tells me so<a name="Page_275"></a>&mdash;that
he went to that house last night and did not leave it
until nearly midnight."</p>

<p>"But why was he there?"</p>

<p>"He went to see the man and woman who lived in the
top room of that lodging-house. I think you know the
woman. She was once your maid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mary Kingston? She came to our house that very
afternoon. She must have asked my father to go to see
her&mdash;he spoke kindly of her to me. But why did Mr.
Trent go there too?"</p>

<p>"There have been secrets kept from us which have
now come to light," said Maurice, sadly. "Oliver went
there to see his brother Francis, who was ill in bed; and
his brother's wife was no other than the woman who acted
as your maid, Mary Kingston&mdash;or rather Mary Trent.
Kingston left your house on Saturday, it seems, because
she had caught sight of her husband in the street: he had
been very ill, and she felt herself obliged to go home with
him and put him to bed. He has been in bed, unable to
rise, she tells me, ever since."</p>

<p>"But she&mdash;<i>she</i>," said Lesley eagerly, "can explain the
whole matter. She must have heard the fight&mdash;the scuffle&mdash;whatever
it was&mdash;upon the stairs. She ought to be able
to tell when father left the house&mdash;and when Mr. Trent left
the house. They did not go together, did they?" there
was a touch of scorn in her voice.</p>

<p>"No, they did not go together. But what Mrs. Trent
alleges is, that your father waited for Oliver on the stairs,
and attacked him there. It is a malicious, wicked lie&mdash;I
am sure of that. But it is what she says she is willing to
swear."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Trent!" Lesley repeated vaguely. "Mrs.
Trent! Do you mean&mdash;Kingston? <i>Kingston</i> swears that
my father lay in wait for Oliver Trent upon the stairs? It
is impossible!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Kingston," Maurice answered, in a low, level voice.
"It is Kingston who has accused your father of the
crime."</p>

<p>Lesley covered her face with her hands, and for a
moment or two did not speak. "It is too terrible," she
said at last, not very steadily. "I do not know how to
believe it. I always trusted her. Is there nobody worth
trusting in the world? Is there no truth and faith anywhere
at all?"<a name="Page_276"></a></p>

<p>The tears were raining down her cheeks as she spoke.
Maurice looked at her with wistful tenderness.</p>

<p>"Can you ask that question when you have <i>such</i> a
father?" he asked. "And I&mdash;have I done anything to
deserve your want of trust?"</p>

<p>She could only sob out incoherent words by way of
answer. "Not you&mdash;not my father&mdash;I was thinking&mdash;of
others&mdash;others I have trusted and been deceived in."</p>

<p>"Oliver Trent," he said&mdash;not as a question so much as
by way of sad assertion. She <a name="tn_281"></a><!-- TN: "draw" changed to "drew"-->drew her handkerchief away
from her eyes immediately, and gazed at him through her
tears, with flushed cheeks and panting breath. What did
he mean? He did not leave her long in doubt.</p>

<p>"Kingston&mdash;Mrs. Trent&mdash;has told a strange story," he
said. "She avers that Oliver was false&mdash;false to my poor
little sister who believed in him so entirely&mdash;false to himself
and false to us. They say you knew of this. She says
that he&mdash;he made love to you, that he asked you to marry
him&mdash;to run away with him indeed&mdash;so late as last Saturday.
She had hidden herself between the folding-doors in
order to hear what went on. Lesley, is this true?"</p>

<p>She was white enough now. She cast one appealing
glance at his face, and then said, almost inaudibly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't tell Ethel."</p>

<p>"Then it was true?"</p>

<p>"Quite true!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" cried Maurice, involuntarily. He did
not use the words with any profane intention: they escaped
his lips as a sort of cry of agony, of protest, almost of
entreaty. He had hoped until this moment that Lesley
would be able to deny this charge. When she acknowledged
its truth, the conviction of Oliver's falsity, the suspicion
of Lesley's faith, smote him like a blow. He drew
back from her a little and looked at her steadfastly. Lesley
raised her candid, innocent eyes to his, and, after a
moment's silence, made her defence.</p>

<p>"I could not help it. If Kingston speaks the truth, she
will tell you that. He locked the door so that I could not
get out, and then ... I said I would never speak to
him again. I was never so angry&mdash;so ashamed&mdash;in all my
life. You must not think that I&mdash;I too&mdash;was false to Ethel.
She is my friend, and I never dreamed of taking him away
from her. I never cared&mdash;in that way&mdash;for him, and even
if I had&mdash;&mdash;"<a name="Page_277"></a></p>

<p>"You never cared? Did you not love him, too?"</p>

<p>"No! no, indeed! I hated him. If Kingston says so
she is lying about me, as she is lying about my father.
You say that you do not believe her when she speaks
against him: surely you won't believe her when she speaks
against me? Can't you trust my father's daughter, as well
as my father?"</p>

<p>The voice was almost passionate in its pleading: the
lovely eyes were eloquent of reproach. Maurice felt his
whole being quiver: he was shaken to the very depths.
Why should she plead to him in this way if she had no love
at all for <i>him</i>? Why should she be so anxious that he
should trust her? And did he not? He could not look
into her face and think for one moment that she lied.</p>

<p>"I do trust&mdash;your father's daughter," he said, hoarsely.
"I trust her above all women living!&mdash;God knows that I
do. You did not love Oliver? It was not to <i>him</i> that you
made some promise you spoke of&mdash;some promise against
engaging yourself?"</p>

<p>"It was to my mother," said Lesley, simply. "I am sorry
that I did not make you understand."</p>

<p>He took a quick step nearer. "May I say more?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;some day?"</p>

<p>"Not now," she answered, softly. But a very faint and
tremulous smile quivered for one moment on her lips. "It
is very wrong to talk of ourselves just now. Go on with
your story&mdash;tell me about my dear, dearest father."</p>

<p>"I will," said Maurice. "I will do exactly what you
wish&mdash;<i>just now</i>"&mdash;with a great accent on the last two
words. "We will talk about that promise at a more fitting
time, Lesley&mdash;I may call you Lesley, may I not? There
is no harm in that, for you are like a sister to my poor
Ethel, and you may as well let me be a brother to you,
dear, <i>just now</i>. Well, Lesley"&mdash;how he lingered over the
name!&mdash;"Mrs. Trent says that she returned to your house
on Monday afternoon in order to warn your father of what
was going, on&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! Did she really?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for your father tells me she did so. She also told
him various stories of Oliver's baseness, which he felt it his
duty to inquire into, and in order that, he might have an
interview with Oliver, she arranged with him to come that<a name="Page_278"></a>
night to the house in Whitechapel, where she and her husband
were living. There she was to confront him with
Oliver, and she said that in <i>her</i> presence he would not
dare to deny that her tales were true."</p>

<p>"But why did father agree to that? Why did he want
to find out?"</p>

<p>"For Ethel's sake. He wanted to protect her. If Mrs.
Trent could prove her stories, he meant to expose Oliver to
Ethel and myself, if it were but an hour before her marriage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And why didn't he?" demanded Lesley, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;<a name="tn_283"></a><!--TN: Quotes removed after "Because" and before "your"-->here comes in your father's evidence&mdash;your
father assures me that when he reached the house that
night and confronted Oliver, the woman took back every
word that she had uttered, and declared that it was all a
lie. And Oliver, of course, persisted that he had done
nothing amiss. Your father says he was so much tempted
to strike Oliver to the ground&mdash;for he did not believe in
Kingston's retractation&mdash;that he flung his stick out upon
the landing lest he should use it too effectually. He forgot
to pick it up, and came away without it. The pocket-book
must of course have fallen out of his pocket as he left the
house."</p>

<p>"Then he could not convict Mr. Trent of anything?"</p>

<p>"No, and so he did not feel justified in meddling. But
he wishes that he had gone to Ethel at once&mdash;or that I had
been at home and that he had come to me. He is reproaching
himself terribly for his silence now."</p>

<p>"As I have been reproaching myself for mine," said
Lesley.</p>

<p>"You have no need. Ethel would never have believed
the stories&mdash;and as Mrs. Trent denied them again, I think
that Oliver would have carried the day. But let her deny
them as she will, I believe that they were true, and that
Oliver was a villain. Our poor Ethel may live to bless the
day when she was delivered from him."</p>

<p>"I am afraid she will never believe us, or forgive us if
she does," sighed Lesley. "But what else happened?"</p>

<p>"Your father left the building, after a long and angry
conversation, about midnight. Oliver remained behind. Of
course your father knows nothing more. But Mrs. Trent
says that Oliver went away ten minutes later, and that she
then heard loud words and the sound of a struggle upon<a name="Page_279"></a>
the stairs. Fights are too common in that neighborhood
to excite much remark. She, however, feeling anxious,
stole down the upper flight of stairs, and distinctly saw Mr.
Brooke and her brother-in-law struggling together. She
maintains that Mr. Brooke's stick was in his hand."</p>

<p>"How wickedly false! Why did she not scream if she
saw such a sight?"</p>

<p>"She was afraid. And she says that she did not think
it would come to&mdash;<i>murder</i>. She crept back to her room
again, and in a few minutes everything was quiet. Only&mdash;in
the early morning the dead body of Oliver Trent was
found upon the stairs, and then she gave information as
to what she had seen and <a name="tn_284"></a><!-- TN: Question mark changed to period after "heard"-->heard."</p>

<p>There was a short silence. Then Lesley said, very tremulously&mdash;"It
sounds like a plot&mdash;a plot against my dear
father's good name!"</p>

<p>"And a very cleverly concocted plot too," thought
Maurice to himself in silent rage; but he dared not say so
much aloud. He only answered, tenderly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Such a plot can never come to good, Lesley. You and
I together&mdash;we will unravel it&mdash;we will clear your father,
and bring him back to the world again."</p>

<p>"He is not coming home just yet, then?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid&mdash;dear, do not tremble so&mdash;he will have to
take his trial. But he will be acquitted, you will see."</p>

<p>She let him press her fingers to his lips again, and made
no outward sign; but the two looked into each other's
eyes, and each was conscious of the presence of a deadly
fear.<a name="Page_280"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">A VAIN APPEAL.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Lesley</span> went home to sleep, and learned from her aunt
the details of her father's arrest. "But he will be back in
a few hours," said Miss Brooke, obstinately. "They will
be obliged to let him ago. They will accept bail, of course.
Mr. Kenyon thinks they will."</p>

<p>"Has Mr. Kenyon been here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; he brought me a message from Caspar.
What a horrible thing it is! But the ridiculous&mdash;absurd&mdash;part
of it is that your father should be accused. Why,
your father was very friendly with Oliver Trent&mdash;at least
he used to be!" Then Miss Brooke paused, and fired an
unexpected question at her niece. "Have you any reason
to think he was not?"</p>

<p>Lesley winced and hesitated. "I don't think he liked
Mr. Trent very much," she said, at last; "but that is a
different thing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From killing him? I should think so!" said Doctor
Sophy, in a high tone of voice. She was in her dressing-gown,
and sitting before the fire that had been lighted in
her own little sanctum upstairs; but she was not smoking
as she was usually at that hour. The occasion was too
serious for cigarettes: Doctor Sophy was denying herself.
Perhaps that was the reason why she looked so haggard
and so angry, as she turned suddenly and spoke to her
niece in a somewhat excited way.</p>

<p>"What made him unfriendly? Do you not know? It
was because you flirted with Oliver Trent! I really think
you did, <a name="tn_285"></a><!--TN: Comma changed to a period after "Lesley"-->Lesley. And I know your father thought so
too."</p>

<p>"Then he ought to have been vexed with me, not with
Oliver," said Lesley, standing her ground, but turning
very pale.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, but you are a girl, and he did not like to
blame you. He spoke rather strongly about Oliver Trent<a name="Page_281"></a>
to me. However, it is no use saying so now. We had
better keep that phase of the matter as quiet as we can."</p>

<p>"Aunt Sophy," said Lesley, in a tremulous tone, "you
don't mean&mdash;you don't think&mdash;that my&mdash;my <i>flirting</i>, as
you call it, with Mr. Trent will be spoken of and tend to
hurt my father&mdash;my father's good name?"</p>

<p>Aunt Sophy stared at her. "Of course it would hurt
your father's chances if it <i>were</i> talked about," she said,
rather, sharply. "I don't see how it could do otherwise.
People would say that he might have quarrelled with Oliver
about you, you know. But we must try to keep the matter
as quiet as we can. <i>I'm</i> prepared to swear that they were
bosom-friends, and that I never heard Caspar say a word
against him; and you had better follow my example."</p>

<p>"But, Aunt Sophy&mdash;if I can't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you want to come the Jeanie Deans' business, my
dear," said Miss Brooke, "you had better reflect that personal
application to the Queen for a pardon will not help
you very much now-a-days. I must confess that, although
I admire Jeanie Deans very much, I don't intend to emulate
her. It's my opinion too that most women will tell
lies for the sake of men they love, but not for the sake of
women."</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Sophy!"</p>

<p>"It is no good making exclamations," said Aunt Sophy,
with unusual irritability. "If you are different from all
other women, I can't help it. I once thought that I was
different myself, but I find I am as great a fool as any of
them. There, go to bed, child! Things will turn out all
right by and by. Nobody could be so absurd as to believe
ill of your father."</p>

<p>"You think it will be all right?" said Lesley, wistfully.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me to believe in a God in heaven, if things
go badly with Caspar," said Miss Brooke, curtly. "Haven't
I lived ten years in the house with the man, and don't I
know that he would not hurt a fly? He's the gentlest soul
alive, although he looks so big and strong: the gentlest,
softest-hearted, most generous&mdash;&mdash;But I suppose it is no
good saying all that to your mother's daughter?"&mdash;and
Miss Brooke picked up a paper-covered volume that had
fallen to her feet, and began to read.</p>

<p>"I am my father's daughter too," said Lesley, with
rather tremulous dignity, as she turned away. She was too<a name="Page_282"></a>
indignant with Miss Brooke to wish her good-night, and
meant to leave the room without another word. But Miss
Brooke, dropping her book on her red flannel lap, and
looking uneasily over her shoulder at her niece's retreating
figure, would not let her go.</p>

<p>"Come, Lesley, don't be angry," she said. "I am so
upset that I hardly know what I am saying. Come here
and kiss me, child, I did not mean to vex you."</p>

<p>And Lesley came back and kissed her aunt, but in
silence, for her heart was sore within her. Was it perhaps
true&mdash;or partially true&mdash;that she had been the cause of the
misery that had come upon them all? Indirectly and
partially, unintentionally and without consciousness of
wrong-doing&mdash;and yet she could not altogether acquit
herself of blame. Had she been more reserved, more
guarded in her behavior, Oliver Trent would never have
fallen in love with her. Would this have mended
matters? If, as she gathered, the sole reason of her
father's visit to the Trents had been to assure himself of
the true nature of her relations with Oliver&mdash;her cheeks
burned as she put the matter in that light, even to herself&mdash;why,
then, she could not possibly divest herself of
responsibility. Of course she could not for one moment
imagine that her father had lifted his hand against Oliver;
but his visit to the house shortly before the murder gave a
certain air of plausibility to the tale: and for this Lesley
felt herself to blame.</p>

<p>She went to her own room and lay down, but she could
not sleep. There was a hidden joy at the bottom of her
heart&mdash;a joy of which she was half ashamed. The relief
of finding that Maurice was still her friend&mdash;it was so that
she phrased it to herself&mdash;was indeed very great. And
there was a strange and beautiful hope for the future, which
she dared not look at yet. For it seemed to her as if it
would be a sort of treason to dream of love and joy and
hope for herself when those that she loved best&mdash;and she
herself also&mdash;were involved in one common downfall, one
common misfortune of so terrible a kind. The thought of
her father&mdash;detained, she knew not where: she had a
childish vision of a felon's cell, very different indeed from
the reality of the plain but fairly comfortable room with
which Mr. Caspar Brooke had been <a name="tn_287a"></a><!-- TN: Question mark changed to comma after "accommodated"-->accommodated, and
she shuddered at the thought of the days before him, of<a name="Page_283"></a>
the public examinations, of the doubt and shame and
mystery in which poor Oliver Trent's death was enwrapped.
She thought of Ethel, now under the influence of a strong
narcotic, from which she would not awake until the morning;
and she shrank in imagination from that awakening
to despair. And she thought of others who were more or
less concerned in the tragedy; of Mary Kingston&mdash;though
she could not remember her without a shudder&mdash;of Mrs.
Romaine, who had loved her brother so tenderly; and of
Lady Alice, the woman whose husband was in prison for
a crime of which Lesley was willing to swear that he was
innocent.</p>

<p>When her thoughts once reached her mother, they stayed
and would not be diverted. She could not sleep: she
could think of nothing but the mother and the father whom
she loved. And she wept over the failure of her schemes
for their reunion. All hope of that was at an end. It was
impossible that Lady Alice should not believe him guilty.
She had always judged him harshly, and taken the worst
possible view of his behavior. Lesley remembered that
she had not&mdash;in common parlance&mdash;"had a good word to
say for him," when she spoke of him in the convent parlor.
What would she say now, and how could Lesley make
her see the truth?</p>

<p>The fruit of her reflections became evident at breakfast-time
next morning. Lesley came downstairs with her hat
on and a mantle over her arm.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" Miss Brooke asked. "Not
to poor Ethel, I hope? I am very sorry for her, but really,
Lesley&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am going to mamma," said Lesley.</p>

<p>"Going to&mdash;&mdash;Well, upon my word! Lesley, I did
think you had a little more feeling for your father!
Going&mdash;&mdash;Well, I shall not countenance it. I shall not
let your boxes go out of the house. It is simply disgraceful."</p>

<p>"But I don't want my boxes," said Lesley, rather forlornly
helping herself to a cup of coffee. "What have my
boxes to do with it, Aunt Sophy? I shall be back in an
hour. Mr. Kenyon said we should be able to see father
to-day, and I do not want to be away when he comes."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then you don't mean to <i>stay</i> with your
mamma?" gasped Aunt Sophy.<a name="Page_284"></a></p>

<p>Lesley could not help a little laugh, but the tears came
into her brown eyes as she laughed. "Would you mind
very much if I did, Aunt Sophy?" she asked, setting down
her cup of coffee.</p>

<p>"I should mind for this reason," said Miss Brooke,
stoutly, "that if you ran away from your father's house
now, people would say that you thought him guilty. It
would go against him terribly. Sooner than that, I would
lock you into your own room and prevent your going by
main force."</p>

<p>"I believe you would," said Lesley, "and so would I,
in your place, Aunt Sophy. But you need not be afraid.
I am as proud of my father and as full of faith in him as
even you can be; and if I go to see my mother, it is only
that I may tell her so, and let her understand that she has
no cause to be afraid for <a name="tn_289"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "him."-->him." The color came to her face
as she spoke, and she lifted her head so proudly that Aunt
Sophy felt&mdash;for a moment or two&mdash;slightly abashed.</p>

<p>"I will be back in an hour," Lesley went on, firmly,
"and I hope that Mr. Kenyon will wait for me if he comes
before I return."</p>

<p>"Am I to tell him where you have gone?" asked Miss
Brooke, with a slight touch of sharpness in her voice.</p>

<p>And Lesley replied, "Certainly. And my father, too, if
you see him before I do. I am not doing anything
wrong."</p>

<p>Greatly to her surprise, Miss Brooke got up and kissed
her. "My dear," she said, "you are very like your
father, and I am sure you won't do anything to hurt his
feelings; but are you quite sure that you need go to Lady
Alice just at present?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure, Aunt Sophy." And then Miss Brooke
sighed, shook her head, and let her go, with the air of one
who sees a person undertake a hopeless quest. For she
fancied that Lesley was going to make an attempt to
reconcile the husband and wife who had been so long separated,
and she did not believe that any such attempt was
likely to succeed. But she had not fathomed Lesley's plan
aright.</p>

<p>The girl took a hansom and drove at once to her mother's
house. She knew well where it was situated, but she had
never visited it before. It was a small house, but in a good
position, close to the Green Park, and at any other moment<a name="Page_285"></a>
Lesley would have been struck by the air of distinction
that it had already achieved. It was painted differently
from the neighboring houses: the curtains and flower-boxes
in the windows were remarkably fresh and dainty,
the neat maid who opened the front door was neater and
smarter than other people's maids. Lesley was informed
that her ladyship was not up yet; and the servant seemed
to think that she had better go away on receiving this
information.</p>

<p>"I will come in," said Lesley, quietly. "I am Miss
Brooke. You can take my name up to her first, if you like,
but I want to see her at once."</p>

<p>The maid looked doubtful, but at this moment Mrs.
Dayman was seen crossing the hall, and her exclamation
of mingled pleasure and dismay caused Lesley to be
admitted without further parley.</p>

<p>Lady Alice was up, but not fully dressed; she was breakfasting
in a dressing-room or boudoir, which opened out
of her own sleeping apartment. As soon as Lesley entered
she started up; and the girl noticed at the first glance that
her mother was looking ill, but perhaps the richly-tinted
plush morning-gown, that fell round her slender figure in
long straight folds, made her look taller and thinner than
usual. Certainly her face was worn, and her eyelids were
reddened as if from weeping or sleeplessness.</p>

<p>"Lesley! my darling! have you come back to me?"</p>

<p>She folded the girl in her arms and pressed her lips
to the soft cheek, a little sob breaking from her as she
spoke.</p>

<p>"Only for half an hour, mamma. Just to speak to you
for a few minutes about <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"Him! Your father! Oh, Lesley, what does it all
mean?"</p>

<p>"Poor mamma! it must have been a great shock to you.
Sit down, and I will tell you all that I know."</p>

<p>And gently pressing Lady Alice back into a seat, Lesley
took a footstool at her mother's knee and told her the story.
Lady Alice listened in silence. With one hand she stroked
Lesley's hair; with the other she held Lesley's fingers, and
Lesley noticed that it twitched from time to time as if in
nervous agitation. Otherwise, however, she was very
calm.</p>

<p>"And so," she said, at last, "you came to tell me the
story as you know it.... But, my child, you have told me<a name="Page_286"></a>
very little that I did not know already. Even in last <a name="tn_291"></a><!-- TN: "night" changed to "night's"-->night's
papers the relationship between Oliver Trent and these
people in Whitechapel was commented on. And your own
name, my darling&mdash;that did not escape. Did you think I
should misunderstand you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, mamma&mdash;not misunderstand <i>me</i>, but I was
afraid lest you might misunderstand some one else."</p>

<p>Lady Alice was silent.</p>

<p>"I was afraid," said Lesley, softly, "lest the years that
have gone by should have made you forget his gentleness
and nobleness of soul&mdash;lest for one moment you should
think him capable of a mean or vile action. I came to tell
you, dearest mother, how impossible it was for us&mdash;who
<i>know</i> him&mdash;to credit for one moment an accusation of this
kind. If all the world said that he was guilty, you and I,
mamma, would know that he was not."</p>

<p>"My child, my darling, you must speak for yourself. Do
not try to speak for me!"</p>

<p>"Mother, won't you give me a message for him?"</p>

<p>"Are you going to see him, Lesley?"</p>

<p>"I hope so. Mr. Kenyon said he would take me."</p>

<p>There was a short silence, and then Lesley lifted her
eyes to her mother's face. She was not encouraged by what
she saw there. It was pale, sad, immobile, and, as it
seemed to Lesley, very cold.</p>

<p>"Mother, I must go. Won't you send him a message?"</p>

<p>"I have no message, Lesley."</p>

<p>"Not one little word?"</p>

<p>"Not one." And then, as if trying to excuse herself
Lady Alice added, hurriedly, "there is nothing that I can
say which would please him. He would not care for any
message from me."</p>

<p>"He would care to hear that you trusted him!"</p>

<p>"I do not think so," said Lady Alice, with a little shake
of her head.</p>

<p>Lesley rose to her feet, silenced for the moment, but not
altogether vanquished. She put her arms round her
mother's neck.</p>

<p>"But you do trust him, mamma? Tell me that, at any
rate."</p>

<p>For almost the first time within Lesley's memory Lady
Alice made a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>"I cannot be catechised; Lesley. Let me alone. You
do not understand."<a name="Page_287"></a></p>

<p>And Lesley was obliged to go away, feeling sorrowfully
that she had failed in her mission. Perhaps, however, she
had succeeded better than she knew.<a name="Page_288"></a></p>

<p class="chapterhead">"AT YOUR SIDE."</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Caspar Brooke</span> was not as yet debarred the privilege of
seeing his friends, and on the morning after his arrest he
had a great many visitors, including, of course, Maurice
Kenyon and his lawyer. Maurice was busying himself
earnestly on his friend's behalf; and, considering the position
that Brooke held, the esteem felt for him in high places,
and the amount of interest that was being brought to bear
on the authorities, there was little doubt but that he would
be let out on bail in a day or two, even if the proceedings
were not quashed altogether. Some delay, however, there
was sure to be owing to the pertinacity of Mary Trent's assertion
that she saw him struggling with Oliver on the stairs,
but in the meantime his detention was allowed to press as
lightly upon him as possible.</p>

<p>It was noon before Lesley saw him, and when she sprang
to his side and threw her arms around his neck, with a
new demonstrativeness of manner, she noticed that his
brows lifted a little, and that he smiled with a look of positive
pleasure and relief.</p>

<p>"So you have come?" he said, holding her to him as if
he did not like to let her go. "I began to wonder if you
had deserted me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, father! Why, I have been waiting ever so long
for Mr. Grierson to go."</p>

<p>"And before that&mdash;&mdash;?" he asked, in rather a peculiar
tone.</p>

<p>"Before that&mdash;I went to see mamma." And Lesley
looked bravely up into his face.</p>

<p>"That was an infringement of contract, as I suppose you
know," said Caspar, smiling persistently. "But it does
not matter very much. What did 'mamma' say to you?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;know," murmured Lesley, confused by the
question. "Nothing very much."<a name="Page_289"></a></p>

<p>"Nothing. Ah, I know what that means." He turned
away from her, and, sitting down, leaned his elbows upon
a table, and played with his beard. "It was useless, Lesley,"
he said, quietly, after a few minutes' silence. "Your mother
is the last person whose sympathies will be enlisted on my
side."</p>

<p>Lesley tried to speak but suddenly felt her voice fail her;
so instead of speaking she knelt down by her father, leaned
her head upon his shoulder, and burst into very heartfelt
tears.</p>

<p>"Little one," said Caspar, "I'm <a name="tn_294"></a><!-- TN: "afaid" changed to "afraid"-->afraid we have both
got ourselves into a mess."</p>

<p>It did not sound comforting, but Lesley stayed her tears
to listen.</p>

<p>"I have been talking to Grierson," her father continued,
"and we have agreed that there must be no suppression of
the truth. My dislike to Oliver Trent has been commented
on already, and I must give a reason for it. Lesley, my
dear, you will have to contribute your own evidence as to
the reason."</p>

<p>Lesley looked up with terrified, wide-open eyes. "Do
you mean that I shall have to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will have to go into the witness-box and tell what
you know, or rather answer the questions that are asked
you."</p>

<p>"But will that be&mdash;best&mdash;for you?" She put the question
with some difficulty.</p>

<p>"That is not the point. What we have to do is to tell
the truth, and leave the result to others."</p>

<p>"&mdash;To God?" Lesley interposed, almost involuntarily.
Caspar Brooke's lip moved with a grave smile.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, to God if you will have it so&mdash;we use different
terms, but perhaps we have the same meaning. We must
at any rate leave the result to the working of various laws
which we cannot control, and to fight against these laws of
nature is wrong-doing&mdash;or sin. Therefore, Lesley, you will
have to tell the truth, whether it may seem to be for my
good or my harm."</p>

<p>She glanced at him rather piteously, and her eyes filled
with tears. Aunt Sophy's words recurred to her mind;
but they seemed feeble and futile in the light of his courage
and steadfastness. Aunt Sophy had been wrong&mdash;so much<a name="Page_290"></a>
was clear to Lesley; and truth was best under all possible
circumstances.</p>

<p>"It is for Ethel I am sorry," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes, poor Ethel. It is true then&mdash;what that woman
said&mdash;that Oliver Trent was in love with you?"</p>

<p>"I could not help it, father. I don't think it was my
fault. I did not know till it was too late."</p>

<p>"I am not blaming you, my dear. When I came into
the drawing-room that day&mdash;do you remember?&mdash;what
had happened then? Can you bear to tell me?"</p>

<p>She hid her face on his shoulder as she answered, "He
was speaking foolishly. I think he wanted to&mdash;to kiss me....
I was very glad that you came in."</p>

<p>"Was that the first time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the first. And I did not even see him again until
that Saturday night, when he found me in the study&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And asked you to run away with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Indeed, I had not led him to think that I would
do any such thing, father. I told him never to speak to
me again. If it had not been for Ethel's sake, I think I
should have called someone&mdash;but I did not like to make a
disturbance."</p>

<p>"No, dear, no. And you&mdash;yourself&mdash;<i>you</i> did not care
for him?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, no, no!"</p>

<p>"It has been a terrible tangle&mdash;and the knot has been
cut very rudely," said Mr. Brooke, in a musing tone. "Of
one thing I am quite certain, we were not fit to have the
care of you, Lesley&mdash;your aunt and I. You would never
have been in this position, my poor child, if we had looked
after you."</p>

<p>"It isn't <i>that</i> which troubles me," said Lesley, trying to
steady her voice. "It is&mdash;that you have to bear the brunt
of it all. If it had not been for me you would never have
been here. It has been my fault!"</p>

<p>"Not your fault, child," said her father. "The fault did
not lie with you, but with that unfortunate young man, for
whom I am truly sorry. Don't be morbid, Lesley; look
things straight in the face, and don't blame yourself unless
you are perfectly sure that you deserve to be blamed."</p>

<p>And there the conference ended, for Miss Brooke
arrived at that moment, and Lesley thought it advisable to<a name="Page_291"></a>
leave the choice of a subject of conversation in her hands.
Caspar had many visitors that day, and many letters of
advice and condolence, for few men were blessed&mdash;or
cursed&mdash;with as many friends as he. Among the letters
that reached him was a note without signature, which he
read hastily, and as hastily concealed when he had read it.
This note was written in uneven, crooked characters, as if
the writer's hand had shaken as she wrote, and ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I ought not to write, but how can I keep silence?
There is nothing that I am not capable of bearing for my
friends. If you will but confide in me&mdash;I am ready to do,
to bear, to suffer anything&mdash;to forgive anything. Let me
see you: I can then speak more freely. If you should be
set at liberty in a day or two, I shall hear. You can then
come to me: if not, I will come to you. But you need
have no fear for me: I shall take means to prevent recognition."</p>

<p>The envelope was plain and of common texture; but
the note-paper was hand-made; with a faint, fine odor as
of some sweet-smelling Eastern wood, and bore in one corner
the letters "R. R.," intertwined in deep blue tints.
There was no doubt in Caspar's mind as to the person from
whom it came.</p>

<p>He received it about three o'clock in the afternoon. If
he wished to decline the proposed interview, he knew that
he must write at once. In his heart he knew also that it
would be better for him and better for her that the interview
should be declined. What had he to do with Rosalind
Romaine? He was accused of murdering her brother: it
was not seemly that she should see him&mdash;even although the
world were not to know of the visit. The world would know
sooner or later&mdash;that was the worst of it: ultimately, the
world knows everything. But why should she wish to see
him? Had she information to impart? If she had, it would
be foolish, from merely conventional reasons, to refuse her
admittance, supposing that she really wished to come. And
in a day or two at most he would certainly be able to go, if
necessary, to her.</p>

<p>But the fact was, he did not believe that she had any
information to impart. She did not say so. Probably she
only wished to express her faith in him, and to assure him
of her friendship. Rosalind had been his friend through<a name="Page_292"></a>
many a long year. She had always shown herself kind
and sympathetic&mdash;in spite of one or two interludes of coldness
and general oddity which Caspar had never felt able
to understand. It would be pleasant enough to hear her
say that she trusted him&mdash;he could not help feeling that.
For, although he had passed the matter off very lightly
when talking to Lesley, he was secretly hurt at the absence
of any message from his wife. He could almost have
worked himself into a rage at the thought of it. "Does
she, too, think me guilty?" he asked himself. "She ought
to know me better, although she does not love me! She
ought to know. And she does know, but she is too cold
and too proud to say so. Poor, warm-hearted Lesley has
tried to win her sympathy for me and failed. Well, I never
expected otherwise: she never gave me what I wanted&mdash;sympathy,
understanding, or love! And how can she
blame me"&mdash;the thought stole unawares into his mind&mdash;"if
I turn for sympathy to one who offers it?"</p>

<p>Yes, Rosalind would sympathize, and there would be no
harm in listening to her gentle words. He had the pen in
his hand, paper and ink before him: a word would be
enough, if he wished to stay her visit. But he would not
write it: if she liked to come, she might come&mdash;he would
be glad to see her. Besides, her letter wanted explanation:
for what had she to <a name="tn_297"></a><!--TN: Quote removed after "forgive?"-->forgive?</p>

<p>He pushed the writing materials away from him, and
went to the fireplace, where a small fire was burning very
dimly. The day was cloudy, and the afternoon was drawing
in. He crushed the coal with the heel of his boot in order
to make a flame leap up; then leaned his elbow on the
narrow mantelpiece and gazed down into the glowing
embers.</p>

<p>The door opened and closed again behind him, but at
first he did not look up. He thought that the attendant
had come to light the gas or bring him some tea. But
when he heard no further sound, he suddenly stirred and
looked up; and in the dim light he saw beside him the
figure of a woman, cloaked and veiled.</p>

<p>Was it Rosalind? No, it was too tall for Rosalind Romaine.
Not Lesley?&mdash;though it had a look of her! And
then his heart gave a tremendous leap (although no one
would have suspected it, for his massive form and bearded
face remained as motionless and calm as ever), for it<a name="Page_293"></a>
dawned upon him that the visitor was none other than
Lesley's mother, his wife, Alice Brooke, who had quitted
him in anger twelve years before.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said, courteously. "I did not
see&mdash;I had no idea who it was. Will you not sit down?"</p>

<p>He handed her a chair, with a bow as formal as that of
a complete stranger. Perhaps the formality was inevitable.
Lady Alice put her hand on the back of the chair, and felt
that she was trembling.</p>

<p>"I hope I am not intruding," she said, in a voice as
formal as his own.</p>

<p>"Not at all. It was most kind of you to come. Pray
sit down."</p>

<p>She seated herself in silence, and then put up her veil.
He remained standing, and for a moment or two the husband
and wife looked each other steadily in the face, with
a sort of curiosity and with a sort of wonder too. The
years had not dealt unkindly with either of them. Lady
Alice had kept her slender grace of figure and her gentleness
of expression, but the traces of sorrow and anxiety
were so visible upon her delicate face that Caspar felt a
sudden impulse of pity towards the woman who had suffered
in her loneliness more than he had perhaps thought possible.
As she sat and looked at him, a certain pathetic
quality showing itself with more than usual vividness in her
soft eyes and drooping mouth, he was conscious of a
desire to take her in his arms and console her for all the
past. But he caught back the impulse with an inward
laugh of scorn. She had no doubt come to run needles
into him, as she used to do in those unlucky days of poverty
and struggle. She had a knack of looking pretty and
sweet while she was doing it, he remembered. It would
not do to show any weakness now.</p>

<p>And she&mdash;what did she think of him? She was less
absorbed with the consideration of any change in him than
with what she intended to say. What impressed her most
were the inflections of his quiet, musical voice&mdash;a voice as
unroughened and as gentle as when it wooed her in her
father's Northern Castle years before! She had forgotten
its power, but it made her tremble now from head to foot
with a sort of terror that was not without charm. It was so
cold a voice&mdash;so cold and calm! She felt that if it once
grew tender and caressing her strength would fail her alto<a name="Page_294"></a>gether.
But there was not much fear of tenderness from
him&mdash;to her.</p>

<p>After that involuntary and rather awkward pause, Lady
Alice recollected herself; and spoke first.</p>

<p>"You must be very much surprised to see me?"</p>

<p>"I am delighted, of course. I could wish"&mdash;with a
slight smile&mdash;"that the apartment was more worthy of you,
and that the circumstances were less disagreeable; but I
am unfortunately not able to alter these details."</p>

<p>"And it is exactly to these details that you owe my
visit," said Lady Alice, with unexpected calmness.</p>

<p>"Then I ought to be grateful them, no doubt."</p>

<p>She moved uneasily, as if the studied conventionality of
his tone jarred on her a little; and then she said, with an
effort that made her words sound brusque,</p>

<p>"I mean that under ordinary circumstances I should
not have come to see you. But these are so strange&mdash;so
extraordinary&mdash;that you will perhaps pardon the intrusion.
I felt&mdash;on reflection&mdash;that it was only right for me to come&mdash;to
express&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She faltered, and he took advantage of her hesitation to
say, with a quiet smile&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am very much obliged to you. But you should not
have taken all this trouble. A note would have answered
the purpose just as well. I suppose you wish to express
your indignation at the little care I seem to have taken of
Lesley. You cannot blame me more severely than I blame
myself. If she had been under your care I have no doubt
we should not be in our present dilemma; but it is no use
fretting over what is past&mdash;or inevitable. I can only say
that I am exceedingly sorry. Will you not loosen your
cloak? This room is rather warm. I can't very well ring
for tea, I am afraid. You should call on me at Woburn
Place, if you want tea."</p>

<p>She loosened her cloak a little at the throat as he suggested.
She had taken off her gloves, and he could see
that her slender white hands were trembling. Somehow it
occurred to him that he had spoken unkindly&mdash;but he did
not know how or why. His words were commonplace
enough. But it was his tone that had been cruel.</p>

<p>"I did not come to make any reproaches or complaints,"
she said at last, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"No. That was very good of you. I have to thank
you, then, for your forbearance."<a name="Page_295"></a></p>

<p>There was still coldness, still something perilously like
scorn, in his tone. It was unbearable to Lady Alice.</p>

<p>"Why do you talk in that way?" she broke out, suddenly.
"I came to say something quite different; and
you speak as if you wanted to taunt me&mdash;to insult me&mdash;to
hurt me in every possible way? I do not understand what
you mean."</p>

<p>"You never did," said Caspar. The scorn had gone
now, and the voice had grown stern. "It is useless for us
to talk together at all. You have made intercourse impossible.
I have no desire to hurt or taunt or insult you,
as you phrase it; but, if I am to speak the truth, I must
say that I feel very strongly that it is to <i>you</i> and <i>your</i>
behavior that we owe the greater part of this trouble. If
you had been at my side, if Lesley had been under a
mother's wing, sheltered as only a mother could shelter
her, there never would have been an opportunity for that
man Trent's clandestine approaches, which will put a
stigma on that poor child for the rest of her life, and may&mdash;for
aught I know&mdash;endanger my own neck! I could put
up with the loss and harm to myself; but once and for all
let me say to you, Alice, that you have neglected your
duty as a mother as much as I have neglected mine as a
father; and that if you had been in your proper place all
this ruin and disgrace and misery might never have come
about."</p>

<p>The broken and vehement tones of his voice showed
that his feelings were powerfully affected. Lady Alice
listened in perfect silence, and kept silence for some
minutes after the conclusion of his speech. Caspar, leaning
with one shoulder against the mantelpiece, looked
frowningly before him, as if he were unconscious of the
fact that she had taken her handkerchief out of her muff,
and was pressing it to her cheeks and eyes. But in reality
he was painfully alive to every one of her movements, and
expected a plaintive rejoinder to his accusations. But
none came. The silence irritated him, as it had formerly
irritated him with Lesley. He was obliged at last to ask
a question.</p>

<p>"Since you say you did not come to reproach me, may
I ask the motive of your visit?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I scarcely think that it is of any use to tell you now,"
said his wife, quietly. She had got rid of her tears now,<a name="Page_296"></a>
and had put her handkerchief away. "I had a sort of
fancy that you might like me to tell you with my own lips
something that I felt rather strongly, but you would
probably resent it&mdash;and it is only a trifle after all."</p>

<p>She rose from her chair and drew her fur-lined cloak
closely round her, as if preparing to depart.</p>

<p>"I should like to hear it&mdash;if I am not troubling you too
much," said Caspar.</p>

<p>She averted her eyes and began slowly to draw on her
gloves. "It is really nothing&mdash;I came on a momentary
impulse. I have not seen you for a good many years, and
we parted with very angry words on our lips, did we not?&mdash;but
I wanted to say that&mdash;although you were sometimes
angry&mdash;I never knew you do a cruel thing&mdash;you were always
kind&mdash;kindest of all to creatures that were weak
(except, perhaps to me); and I am quite sure&mdash;sure as
that I stand here&mdash;that you never did the thing of which
they are accusing you. There!"&mdash;and she looked straight
into his face&mdash;"it is a little thing, no doubt: you have
hosts of friends to say the same thing to you: but my tribute
is worth having, perhaps, because, after all, I am
your wife&mdash;and in some ways I do understand!"</p>

<p>Caspar's face worked strangely: he bit his lip hard as
he looked at her.</p>

<p>"You are generous, Alice," he said, in a low voice, after
a pause that seemed eternal to her.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Why should you call it generous? I only
wanted to say this&mdash;and also&mdash;that if I can be of any use
to you now, I am ready. A little thing sometimes turns
the course of public opinion. If I were to go to Woburn
Place&mdash;to stay with Lesley, for instance&mdash;so that all the
world could see that I believed in you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I shall be at Woburn Place myself in a day or
two, on bail; and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I could stay," said Lady Alice, again looking at him.
Then her eyes dropped and the color mounted to her forehead.
He made a sudden step towards her.</p>

<p>"Alice&mdash;is it possible&mdash;after all these years&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, it is not possible," she said, with a little laugh
which yet had something in it of a sob, "and I don't
think we should ever get on together&mdash;and I don't love
you at all, except for Lesley's sake&mdash;but just until this
horrible affair is over, if I might show everybody that I<a name="Page_297"></a>
have all possible faith in you, and that I know you to be
good and upright and honorable&mdash;just till then, Caspar, I
<i>should</i> like to be at your side."</p>

<p>But whether Caspar heard the whole of this speech must
remain for ever doubtful, as, long before its close, he had
taken her in his arms and was sealing the past between
them with a long kiss which might verily be called the
kiss of peace.<a name="Page_298"></a></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">"OUT ON BAIL."</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Miss Brooke</span> was electrified. Such a thing had never
occurred to her as possible. After years of separation, of
dispute, of ill-feeling on either side, here was Lady Alice
appearing in her husband's house, and expressing a desire
to remain in it. She came to Woburn Place on the evening
after her interview with Caspar, and at once made known
her wishes to Doctor Sophy.</p>

<p>It was a curious interview. Miss Brooke sat bolt upright
on a sofa, with an air of repressed indignation which
was exceedingly striking: Lady Alice, half enveloped in
soft black furs, was leaning back in the lowest and most
luxurious chair the room afforded, with rather more the air
of the <i>grande dame</i> than she actually wished to convey.
In reality her heart was very soft, and there was moisture
in her eyes; but it was difficult for her to shake off an
appearance of cold indifference to all the world when Miss
Sophia Brooke, M. D., was in her society. She had never
understood Doctor Sophy, and Miss Brooke had always
detested her.</p>

<p>"Am I to understand, Lady Alice," said the spinster, in
her stiffest voice, "that my brother wishes you to take
up your abode in this house during his absence?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so," said Lady Alice, equably. "He has
wished me to take up my abode here for some time past."</p>

<p>"Indeed?"</p>

<p>The note of incredulity in her voice angered Caspar's
wife.</p>

<p>"I think you hardly understand," she said with some
quiet dignity, "that I have been to see Mr. Brooke this
afternoon. Strange circumstances demand new treatment,
Miss Brooke. I consulted with my husband as to what we
had better do, and he agreed with me that it would be
better for Lesley if I came here&mdash;at any rate for the present."<a name="Page_299"></a></p>

<p>"Better for Lesley!" Miss Brooke was evidently
offended. "I do not think that you need put yourself to
any inconvenience&mdash;even for Lesley's sake. I will take
care of her."</p>

<p>"But I happen to be her mother," said Lady Alice, with
a touch of amusement. It struck her as odd that Miss
Brooke only amused her now, and did not make her angry
at all. "And we have the world to think of, besides."</p>

<p>"I scarcely thought you troubled yourself very much
about what the world said," remarked Aunt Sophy, severely.
"It has said a good deal during the last ten or twelve
years."</p>

<p>"At least it shall not say," responded Lady Alice, "that
I believe my husband guilty of murder. I have come back
to prevent <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>Miss Brooke looked at her doubtfully. She was not a
person of very quick perceptions.</p>

<p>"You mean," she said at last, "that you have come
back&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Because</i> he was accused of murder," said Lady Alice,
clearly, "and I choose to show the world that I do not
believe it."</p>

<p>And Lesley, entering from the library, heard the words,
and stood transfixed for a moment with pure delight. Then
she sprang forward, fell on her knees before her mother,
and embraced her with such fervor that Miss Brooke put
up her eye-glasses and gazed in surprise.</p>

<p>"Mother! my own dearest mother! You do believe in
him, then! and you have come to show us that you do!
Oh! how delighted he will be when he knows!"</p>

<p>A little color showed itself in Lady Alice's delicate face.
"He does know," she whispered, almost with the coyness
of a girl.</p>

<p>"And he <i>was</i> delighted, was he not? It would be such
a comfort to him&mdash;just now when he wants every kind of
comfort. Oh, mamma, it is so good of you, and I am so
glad. Aunty Sophy, aren't you glad, too?"</p>

<p>Lady Alice tried to stifle this na&iuml;ve utterance, but it
would not be repressed, and Aunt Sophy had to rise to the
occasion as best she could, with rather a grim face, she
rose from her seat upon the sofa and advanced towards her
brother's wife, holding out a very reluctant hand.</p>

<p>"I appreciate your motives, Lady Alice, and I see that
your conduct may be of service to my brother." Then she<a name="Page_300"></a>
relapsed into a more colloquial tone. "But how on earth
you mean to live in this part of London, I'm sure I can't
imagine. No doubt it seems rather smoky and grimy to
you after Mayfair and Belgravia."</p>

<p>"London is generally a little smoky," said Lady Alice,
smiling in spite of herself. "Thank you, Sophy: I thought
you would do me justice."</p>

<p>And the hands of the two women met in a friendlier grasp
than ever in the days of yore.</p>

<p>"I must see about your room," said Miss Brooke, practically.
It was her way of holding out the olive branch.
"You would like to be near Lesley, I suppose. We shall
try to make you comfortable, but, of course, you won't
expect the luxuries of your own home here."</p>

<p>"I shall be very comfortable, I am sure," said Lady
Alice.</p>

<p>"What, does she mean by talking in that tone?" cried
Lesley, hotly when Doctor Sophy had left the room. "It
was almost insulting!"</p>

<p>"No, my darling, no. It is only a memory of old times
when I was&mdash;exacting and dissatisfied. Yes, I see that I
must have seemed so, then. I had not had much experience
in those days; and then your father was not a man of substance
as he seems to be now," said Lady Alice, inspecting
the room, with a half-smile. The smile died quickly away,
however, and was succeeded by a sad look, and a sigh.
"Ah, poor Caspar!"</p>

<p>"He will be home in a day or two. Everybody says
so."</p>

<p>"I trust so, dearest. And I will stay with&mdash;you till he
comes home."</p>

<p>"Oh, but now that you have come, mamma you will
never be allowed to go away again."</p>

<p>"I never said that, Lesley. I have come to maintain a
principle, that is all. A wife ought to show that she trusts
her husband, if he is falsely accused."</p>

<p>And then Lady Alice lowered her eyes and changed the
subject, for it suddenly occurred to her that she had not
been very ready, in her younger years, to give the trust
that now seemed to be her husband's due.</p>

<p>But she settled down quite naturally in her husband's
home during the next few days. Lesley, remembering the
discomfort of her own first few weeks, expected her to say<a name="Page_301"></a>
that the house was hideous and the neighborhood detestable.
But Lady Alice said nothing of the kind. She
thought it a fine old house&mdash;well-built and roomy&mdash;far
preferable, she said, to the places she had often occupied
in the West End. With different furniture and a little good
taste it might be made absolutely charming. And when
she got as far as "absolutely charming," uttered with her
chin pillowed on one hand, and her eyes roving meditatively
over the drawing-room mantelpiece, Lesley smiled to
herself, and gave up all fear that she would ever go away
again. Lady Alice had evidently come to the conclusion
that it was her duty to see that Caspar's house was
thoroughly redecorated from top to bottom.</p>

<p>But she did not come to this conclusion all at once.
There were days when the minds of mother and daughter
were too full of sorrow and anxiety to occupy themselves
with upholstery and bric-a-brac. And the day of the adjourned
inquest, when Caspar Brooke was allowed to go to
his own house on bail, was one of the worst of all.</p>

<p>He came home quietly that afternoon in company with
Maurice Kenyon, greeted his family affectionately but with
something of a melancholy air, then went at once to his
study, where he shut himself up and began to write and
read letters. The cloud was hanging over him still. He
knew well enough that if he had been a poor man, of no
account in the world, he would at that moment have been
occupying a prison cell instead of his own comfortable
study. For presumption was strong against him; and it
had taken a great deal of influence and extraordinarily high
bail to secure his release. At present he stood committed
to take his trial for manslaughter within a very short space
of time. And nobody had succeeded, or seemed likely to
succeed, in throwing any doubt on the testimony of Mary
Trent. He was certainly in a very awkward position: it
might be a very terrible position by-and-bye.</p>

<p>He was aroused from the reverie into which he had fallen
by the entry of a servant with a note. He opened it, read
the contents slowly, and then put it into the fire. He stood
frowning a little as he watched it burn.</p>

<p>After a few moments of this hesitation he rang the bell,
told Sarah that he was going out, and left the house. The
three women in the drawing-room upstairs, already nervous
and overstrained from long suspense, all started when the<a name="Page_302"></a>
reverberation of that closing door made itself heard. Lesley
felt her mother's hand close on hers with a quick, convulsive
pressure. She looked up.</p>

<p>"He has gone out!" Lady Alice murmured, so that
Lesley alone could hear. "He does not come&mdash;to <i>us</i>!"</p>

<p>Lesley did not know what to say. She was surprised to
find that her mother expected him to come. But then she
was only Caspar Brooke's daughter and not his wife.</p>

<p>Lady Alice lay back in her chair, closed her eyes and
waited. She had once been a jealous woman: there were
the seeds of jealousy in her still. She sat and wondered
whether Caspar had gone for sympathy and comfort to any
other woman. And after wondering this for half an hour
it suddenly occurred to her mind with the vividness of a
lightning flash that if things <i>were</i> so&mdash;if her husband <i>had</i>
found sympathy elsewhere&mdash;it was her own fault. She had
no right to accuse him, or to blame him, when she had left
him for a dozen years.</p>

<p>"I have no right to blame him, perhaps, but I have still
a right to know," she said to herself. And then, disengaging
her hand from Lesley's clinging fingers, she rose
and went downstairs&mdash;down to the study which she had
so seldom visited. She seated herself in Caspar's arm-chair,
and prepared to wait there for his return. Surely
he would not be long!&mdash;and then she would speak to him,
and things should be made clear.</p>

<p>Caspar's note had been written by Mrs. Romaine. It
was quite formal, and merely contained a request that he
would call on her at his earliest convenience. And he
complied at once, as she had surmised that he would do.
Her confidential maid opened the door to him, and conducted
him to the drawing-room. It was dusk, and the
blinds were drawn down. Oliver Trent's funeral had taken
place the day before.</p>

<p>Mr. Brooke did not sit down. He knew that the interview
which was about to take place was likely to be a painful
one, but he could not guess in the least what kind of
turn it would take. Did Rosalind believe in his guilt?
Did she know what manner of man her brother Oliver had
been? Was she going to reproach or to condole? She
had done a strange thing in asking him to the house at all,
and at another time he might have thought it wiser not to
accede to her request; but he was in the mood in which<a name="Page_303"></a>
the most extraordinary incidents seem possible, and scarcely
anything could have seemed to him too bizarre to happen.
He felt curiously impatient of the ordinary conventionalities
of civilized life. Since this miraculous thing had come to
pass&mdash;that he, Caspar Brooke, a respectable, sane, healthy-minded
man of middle-age, could be accused of killing a
miserable young scamp like Oliver Trent in a moment of
passion&mdash;the world had certainly seemed somewhat crazy
and out of joint. It was not worth while to stand very
much on ceremony at such a conjuncture; and if Rosalind
Romaine wanted to talk to him about her dead brother, he
was willing to go and hear her talk. And yet as he stood
in her dainty little drawing-room, it came over him very
strongly that he ought not to be there.</p>

<p>He was still musing when the door opened, and Rosalind
stole into the room. He did not hear her until she was
close upon him, and then he turned with a sudden start.
She looked different&mdash;she was changed. Her face was
very pale: her eyelids were reddened: she was dressed in
the deepest black, and over her head she had flung a black
lace veil, which gave her&mdash;perhaps unintentionally&mdash;a
tragic look. She held the folds together with her right
hand, and spoke to him quietly.</p>

<p>"It was kind of you to come," she said.</p>

<p>"You summoned me. I should not have come without
that," he answered, quickly.</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not. And of course&mdash;in the ordinary
course of things&mdash;I ought not to have summoned you.
The world would say that I was wrong. But we have been
old friends for many years now, have we not?"</p>

<p>"I always thought so," he answered, gravely. "But
now&mdash;I fear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean"&mdash;with a strange vibration in her voice&mdash;
"you mean that we must never be friends again&mdash;because&mdash;because
of Oliver&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This accusation must naturally tend to separate the
families," he said, in a very calm, grave voice. "Even
when it is disproved, we shall not find it easy to resume
old relations. I am very sorry for it, Rosalind, just as I
need not tell you how sorry I am for the cause&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She interrupted him hurriedly. "Yes, yes, I know all
that; but you speak of <i>disproving</i> the charge. Can you
do that?"<a name="Page_304"></a></p>

<p>He was silent for a moment. "I shall do my best," he
said at length, with some emotion in his voice.</p>

<p>"And if it is not disproved&mdash;what then?" she asked.
"Suppose they call it <i>murder</i>?"</p>

<p>Caspar drew himself up: a certain displeasure began to
mark itself upon his features.</p>

<p>"Need you ask me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I need. I want you to consider the answer that
you would give. I have a reason."</p>

<p>Her eager eyes, hot and burning in a face that was
strangely white, pled for her. Caspar relented a little, but
bent his brows as he replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"The extreme penalty of the law, I suppose. It is
absurd&mdash;but, of course, it is possible. It is not a case in
which I should expect penal servitude for life to be substituted,
supposing that I were found guilty. But I fail to see
your motive for asking what must be to me a rather painful
question."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are strong! You can bear it!" she said,
dropping her face upon her hands. Caspar gazed at her
in amazement. He began to wonder whether she were
going out of her mind. But before he could find any word
of calming or consoling tendency, she flung down her
hands and spoke again. "I want you to fix your mind on
it for a moment, even although it hurts you," she said.
"You are a strong man&mdash;you do not shrink from a thing
because, it is a little painful. Think what it would mean
for yourself, and not for yourself only; for your friends,
for those who love you! A perpetual disgrace&mdash;a
misery!"</p>

<p>"You seem anxious to assume that I shall be convicted,"
he said, still with displeasure.</p>

<p>"I tell you I am doing so on purpose. I want you to
think of it. You know&mdash;you know as well as I do&mdash;that
the chances are against you!"</p>

<p>"And if they are?"</p>

<p>"If they are&mdash;why do you incur such a risk!"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Romaine," said Caspar, gently, but with a steady
coldness of tone, of which she did not at first feel the
import, "I think you hardly know the force of what you
are saying. I do not incur any risk unnecessarily or wantonly:
I only wish the truth to be made known. What
can I do more&mdash;or less?"<a name="Page_305"></a></p>

<p>"You could go away," she said, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>If the room had been lighter, she might, perhaps, have
seen the frown that was gathering on his brow, the wrath
that darkened his eyes as he spoke: but his face was in
shadow, and for a moment anger made him speechless.
She went on eagerly, breathlessly, without waiting for a
reply.</p>

<p>"You might get off quite easily to&mdash;to Spain, perhaps,
or some place where there was no extradition treaty. You
are out on bail, I know; but your friends could not complain.
Surely it is a natural enough thing for a man, situated
as you are, to wish to escape: nobody would blame
you in the long run&mdash;they would only say that you were
wise. And if you stay, everything is against you. You
had so much better take your present chance!"</p>

<p>Caspar muttered something inarticulate, then seemed to
choke back further utterance, and kept silence for a minute.
When he spoke it was in a curiously tranquil tone.</p>

<p>"You do not seem to have heard of the quality that
men call their honor?"</p>

<p>"Oh, honor! I have heard enough about honor," she
answered with a nervous, rasping laugh. "And you&mdash;<i>you</i>
to talk about honor&mdash;after&mdash;after <i>what you have done</i>!"</p>

<p>Caspar Brooke fell back a step or two and surveyed her
curiously. <a name="tn_310"></a><!--TN: "God God" changed to "Good God"-->"Good God!" The exclamation broke from
him, as if against his will. "You speak as though you
thought I was guilty&mdash;as though I had&mdash;<i>murdered</i>
Oliver!"</p>

<p>And she, looking at him as intently as he looked at her,
said only, in the simplest possible way&mdash;</p>

<p>"And did you not?"<a name="Page_306"></a></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" class="newpg">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">LOVE OR TRUST.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Caspar</span> turned away. For a moment he felt mortally sick,
as if from a pang of acute physical pain. Distrust from
an old friend is always a hard thing to bear. And so, for
a moment or two, he did not speak.</p>

<p>"I was not surprised," said Mrs. Romaine, quickly. "I
had been looking for something of the kind. I won't say
that you were not justified&mdash;in a certain sense. Oliver
acted abominably, I know. He told me what he was going
to do beforehand."</p>

<p>"Told you what he was going to do?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;to make Lesley fall in love with him. He did
not mean to marry her. He meant to gain her affections
and then to&mdash;to&mdash;leave her, to break her heart. I suppose
that is what you found out. I do not wonder that you
were surprised."</p>

<p>"No doubt you have good authority for what you are
saying," said Mr. Brooke, very coldly, "but your account
does not tally with what I have gathered from other
sources."</p>

<p>"From Lesley herself?"</p>

<p>Caspar bowed his head. He was conscious of a violent
dislike to bringing Lesley's name into the discussion. Mrs.
Romaine went on rapidly.</p>

<p>"As to Lesley, of course I cannot say. I don't know
whether he failed or succeeded. Oliver very seldom failed
with women when he tried. But, of course, he was going
to marry Ethel; and that meant that if he <i>had</i> succeeded
Lesley had been thrown over. It is not like me to put
things so baldly, is it? I see that I disgust you. But I
do not know that I need apologize. You are man of the
world enough to understand that at certain crises we are
obliged to speak our minds, to face the truth boldly and
see what it means. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"It may be so, but I am not aware that the present crisis
demands such plain speaking."<a name="Page_307"></a></p>

<p>"Then you must be blind," said his hearer, with a burst
of indignation, "blind&mdash;blind&mdash;<i>blind</i>! Or mad? is that
it? What sort of crisis do you expect? What can be
worse than the present state of things? Are not your life
and her character at stake? Why do you not take your
present opportunity and save her and yourself? Look the
matter in the face and decide?"</p>

<p>"I would rather not discuss it," said Caspar. "The
course you indicate is not one that could be taken by any
honorable man. It is&mdash;it is&mdash;absurd." The last word was
evidently the substitute for a much stronger one in his
mind. "I see no use in talking about the matter. We are
only giving ourselves useless pain."</p>

<p>There was a short silence. Mrs. Romaine drew her veil
more tightly round her face, and seemed to deliberate.
Caspar threw a longing glance&mdash;which she intercepted&mdash;towards
the door.</p>

<p>"Men are such cowards," she said at last, in a low and
bitter tone. "I have proved <i>that</i> in every way: I ought
to be prepared for cowardice&mdash;even from you. They want
to slip out of every unpleasant position, and leave some
woman to bear the brunt of it. You, for instance, want to
go now, this minute, because I have said one or two things
that pain you. You don't care enough for what I think to
make you wish to alter my opinion&mdash;to fight it out and
conquer me; you only want to get away and leave me to
'cool down,' as you would call it. You are mistaken. I
am not speaking from any momentary irritation: what I
say to you to-day is the result of long thought, long consideration,
long patience. It would be better for you to
have the courage and the manliness to listen to me."</p>

<p>"You talk in a very extraordinary way, Rosalind,", said
Caspar. "I do not understand it, and I fail to see its justice
towards me. I have never refused to listen to you, have I?
As for cowardice&mdash;it seemed to me that you were trying to
persuade me to do a very cowardly thing just now; but
perhaps I was mistaken. I will hear all that you have to
say: if I was anxious to go, it was only that I might save
you from tiring or hurting yourself."</p>

<p>"It matters so much whether I am tired or hurt, does it
not?" she said, with the faintest possible flicker of a smile
on her white lips. "That is what you all think of&mdash;whether
one suffers&mdash;suffers physically. It is my soul that is hurt,<a name="Page_308"></a>
my heart that is tired&mdash;but you don't concern yourself
with that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"I assure you that I am very sorry&mdash;&mdash;," he began, and
then he stopped short. She had made it very difficult for
him to say anything so commonplace, and yet so true.</p>

<p>"If you are sorry," she said, in a softer tone, "and if
you want to make me happier&mdash;<i>save yourself</i>."</p>

<p>"No," said Caspar, roughly&mdash;almost violently&mdash;"by
Heaven, I won't do that."</p>

<p>"You don't wish to save yourself?"</p>

<p>"Not at that price&mdash;the price of my honor."</p>

<p>"Listen to me," she said, drawing nearer to him and
speaking very softly. "I have made it my business during
the last day or two&mdash;when I gathered that you would be
let out on bail&mdash;to collect all the information that might be
useful to you. You could get away to-morrow or next day
by a vessel that leaves Southampton at the time I have
marked on this paper. It is not an ordinary steamer&mdash;not
a passenger-ship at all&mdash;and no one will know that you
are on board. It would take you to Oporto. You would
be safe enough in the interior&mdash;a friend of mine who went
there once told me that there were charming palaces and
half-ruined castles to let, where one could live as in paradise,
amidst the loveliest gardens, full of fountains and
birds and flowers."</p>

<p>Her voice took on a caressing tone, as if she were dreaming
of perfect happiness. "How like a woman," thought
Caspar to himself, "to think only of the material side of
life?" Then he corrected himself: "Like some women:
not like all, thank-God!"</p>

<p>"So you would condemn me to exile and loneliness as
well as to dishonor?" he said. It was as much as he
could do not to laugh outright at the chimerical idea.</p>

<p>"It is no exile to a cosmopolitan like yourself to live
out of England," she answered, scornfully. "As to dishonor&mdash;what
will you not have to suffer if you stay in
England? Where is your reputation now? And as to
loneliness&mdash;don't you know&mdash;do you not see&mdash;that you
<a name="tn_313"></a><!--TN: "need need" changed to "need"-->need not go&mdash;alone?"</p>

<p>She put her left hand gently on his arm, and for a
moment there was silence in the room. Her heart beat so
loudly that she was afraid of his hearing it. But she need
not have feared; his mind was far too much occupied with<a name="Page_309"></a>
more important matters to be able to take cognizance of
such a detail as the state of Mrs. Romaine's pulse.</p>

<p>His first impulse was one of intense indignation and
anger. His second was one of pity. These feelings
alternated in him when at last he forced himself to speak.
Which of the two predominated he hardly knew. Perhaps
pity: because it drove him, almost as a matter of self-respect,
to make a pretence of not knowing what she
meant.</p>

<p>"Anything is exile to a man who leaves his home," he
said sternly. "To a man who leaves his wife and daughter&mdash;do
you understand? As for the dishonor of such a
course, it seems as if you could not comprehend that: my
feelings on the subject are evidently beyond your ken.
But you can understand this&mdash;first, that I should go
nowhere into no exile, into no new home, without my
wife; and, secondly, that <i>she</i>, at least, trusts me&mdash;she
knows that I have not your brother's blood upon my
hands."</p>

<p>Rosalind's fingers had slipped from his arm when he
began to speak: she knew that if she had not removed
them then they would have been shaken off. He could
see them amongst the folds of black lace at her breast&mdash;clutching,
tearing, as if she had not room to breathe.</p>

<p>"Your wife!" she said, with a gasp. "I did not know....
She has been beforehand with me, then! And
it is she&mdash;she&mdash;that you will take&mdash;to Spain?"</p>

<p>"There is no question of Spain. I mean to stay here
in England and fight the matter out. My wife would be
the first person to tell me so. I cannot imagine her speaking
to me again if I were coward enough to run away."</p>

<p>"She would not do for you what I have done!" cried
the unhappy woman, now, as it seemed, beside herself.
"If she believes you innocent, so much the easier for her!
But I&mdash;I&mdash;believe you guilty&mdash;yes, Caspar Brooke, I
believe that you killed my brother&mdash;and I do not care! I
loved him, yes; but I love you&mdash;<i>you</i>&mdash;a thousand times
more!"</p>

<p>"You do not know what you are saying. You are mad.
Be silent, Rosalind," said Caspar Brooke, in a deep tone
of anger. But she raved on.</p>

<p>"Have I not been silent for years? And who is as
faithful to you as I have been? It is easy to love a man<a name="Page_310"></a>
who is innocent; but not a man who is guilty! Guilty or
not&mdash;I do not care. It is you that I care for&mdash;and you
may have as many sins as you please upon your soul&mdash;but
they are nothing to me. I am past anything now but
speaking the truth. Have you no pity for a woman to
whom you are dearer than her own soul?"</p>

<p>She would have thrown herself at his feet, if he had not
prevented her. He was touched a little by her suffering,
but he was also immeasurably angered and disgusted.
An exhibition of uncontrolled feeling was not the way to
charm him. His one desire now became the desire to
escape.</p>

<p>"I should have no pity," he said, gravely, "for my own
selfishness and cowardice, if I took advantage of this
moment of weakness on your part. It <i>is</i> weakness, I hope&mdash;I
will not call it by any other name. You will recover
from it when the stress of this painful time is over, and
you will be glad to forget it as I shall do. Believe me, I
will not think of it again. It shall be in my mind as
though you had not said it; and, though it will be
impossible for us to continue on our former terms of
friendship, I shall always wish for your welfare, and hope
that time will bring you happiness and peace."</p>

<p>She made no answer. She lay where he had placed her,
her head buried amongst the cushions, crushed to the very
earth. She would not look at him, would not make semblance
to have heard. And he, without hesitation, went
deliberately to the door and let himself out. He gained the
street without being intercepted, and drew a long breath
of relief when he felt the soft night air playing on his
heated brow. The moralist would have said that he came
off victor; but he had a sense, as he went out along the
pavement, of being only a defeated and degraded man.
There was not even the excitement of gratified vanity, for
an offered love which did not include perfect trust in his
honor was an insult in itself. And Caspar Brooke's
integrity of soul was dear to him.</p>

<p>It was perhaps impossible for him&mdash;a mere man&mdash;to
estimate the extent of suffering to which his scorn had subjected
the woman that he left behind. Rosalind remained
as he had seen her, crouching on the ground, with her
head on the sofa cushions, for full two hours or more.
When she rose she went to her own room and lay upon her<a name="Page_311"></a>
bed, refusing for many hours either to eat or to speak.
She did not sleep: she lay broad awake all night, recalling
every tone of Caspar's voice, and every passing expression
of his face. She was bitterly humiliated and ashamed.
But she was not ashamed in the sense of shame for wrong-doing:
she was only ashamed because he had rebuffed
her. She was sick with mortification. She had offered
him everything in her power&mdash;peace, safety, love: she had
offered him <i>herself</i> even, and been rejected with scorn.
Nothing crushes a woman like this humiliation. And in
some women's natures such an experience will produce
dire results; for loss of self-respect is resented as the
worst injury that man can inflict, and is followed by deadly
hatred to the man who has inflicted it. It may be argued
by the more logical male that the woman has brought it all
upon herself; but no affronted, humiliated, shame-stricken
woman will ever allow this to be the fact. The sacrifice
she conceives to have been all her own; but the pain has
come from <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>This was the way in which Rosalind looked at the matter.
And mistaken as she was in her view of the moralities and
proprieties of the situation, she suffered an amount of pain
which may well arouse in us more pity than Caspar Brooke
felt for her. The burning, stinging sense of shame seemed to
make her whole soul an open wound. It was intolerable.
The only way out of it, she said to herself at first, is to die.
There was an old song that rang in her ears continually,
as if somebody were repeating it over and over again.
She could not remember it all&mdash;only a line here and there.
"When lovely woman stoops to folly," it began, what art
can wash her tears and stains and shame away? And the
answer was what Rosalind herself had already given:
the only way "to rouse his pity" was "to die!" She
almost laughed at herself for repeating the well-worn,
hackneyed, century-old ditty. People did not die <a name="tn_316"></a><!--TN: "nowadays" changed to "now-a-days"-->now-a-days,
either of broken hearts or of chloral, when their
lovers deserted them. And Caspar Brooke had never
been her lover. No, he had only given her pain; and she
wished that she could make him suffer, too. "Revenge"
was too high-flown a word; but if she could see him heartbroken,
ruined, disgraced, she would be&mdash;not satisfied, but
she would feel her pain allayed.</p>

<p>Caspar Brooke walked for an hour before he was calm
enough to remember that he ought to go home. When this<a name="Page_312"></a>
idea once occurred to him, he felt a pang of shame for his
own forgetfulness. What would Alice think of him? And
this was the first day that she had been with him in
his house for so many years. He must go home and
make his apologies. Not that she would expect very
much attention from him. Had she not said that she was
only trying to do her duty? Probably she disliked him
still.</p>

<p>He let himself in with his latch-key, and walked straight
into the study. A shaded lamp had been lighted, and
but faintly illuminated the corners of the room. But
there was light enough for him to see that Lady Alice
was sitting in his chair. He came up to the table, and
looked at her without speaking. There was a strange
tumult of feeling in his heart. He wished that he could
tell her how gratified he was by her trust in him, how
much he prized the very things that had once irritated him
against her&mdash;her reserve, her fine perception, her excellent
fastidiousness of taste, even that little air of coldness that
became her so well. To come into her presence was like
entering a fragrant English garden, after stifling for an
hour in a conservatory where the air was heavy with the
perfume of stephanotis.</p>

<p>She rose, as he continued silent, and stood on the rug,
almost face to face with him. She did not find it easy to
speak, and there was something in his air which frightened
her a little. She made a trivial remark at last, but with
great difficulty.</p>

<p>"You have been away a long time," she said.</p>

<p>She was not prepared for the answer. He put out his hand
and drew her close to him. "You were away a great deal
longer," he said, looking down at her fair, serious face.
She could not reply. "Twelve years, is it not?" he went
on. "That's a long time out of one's life, Alice. I feel
myself an old man now."</p>

<p>"No, no, Caspar!" she said, tremulously.</p>

<p>"What was it all about, Alice? You know I never
really understood it. Can't you make me understand?
Was it that I was simply unbearable? too disagreeable to
be put up with any longer."</p>

<p>"No, it was not that. I will speak the truth now,
Caspar. I was jealous&mdash;I thought you cared for Rosalind
Romaine."<a name="Page_313"></a></p>

<p>"But you know now&mdash;surely&mdash;that that was not true?"</p>

<p>"Could you swear it?" she asked, suddenly and sharply,
with a quick look into his face.</p>

<p>For a moment he was annoyed. Then his brow cleared,
and he answered, very gravely&mdash;</p>

<p>"I can and will, if you like. But I thought&mdash;having
trusted me so far&mdash;that you could trust me without an
oath. Alice, I never loved any woman but one: and that
one was yourself. Have you been as true to me as I have
been to you?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I ever knew that I loved you until now,"
said Alice, laying her head with a deep sigh upon her
husband's breast.</p>

<p>"Love is not enough, though it is a great deal: do you
trust me?"</p>

<p>"Implicitly&mdash;now that I have looked at you again."</p>

<p>Caspar gave a little laugh.</p>

<p>"Then I must never let you go away from me, or you
will begin to disbelieve in me," he said.<a name="Page_314"></a></p>

Lesley had spoken in her letters, and also the doctor who
had interested her at the hospital. She did not speak to
Lesley about him: she took a little time to accustom herself
to her husband's circle before she made any remarks
upon its members. But she was shrewd enough to see very
quickly that Mr. Kenyon took even more interest in her
daughter than in her husband, and from Lesley's shy looks
she fancied that the interest was reciprocated. She had a
twinge of regret for her favorite, Harry Duchesne, and then
consoled herself by saying that after all Lesley was too
young to know her own mind, and that probably she would
change before she was twenty-one.</p>

<p>She did not come particularly into contact with Maurice,
however, until the Sunday after she had taken up her abode
in Woburn Place. And then she saw a good deal of him.
For Lesley went to sit with Ethel as was her wont, and
Maurice came to dine at Mr. Brooke's. After the early
dinner, Lady Alice noticed that there was some parleying
between the guest and his host.</p>

<p>"I am going," said Maurice in an urgent undertone. To
which Caspar returned a cheerful answer.</p>

<p>"All right, old man; but I am going too." And then
Mr. Kenyon knitted his brows and looked vexed.</p>

<p>Caspar at once noted his wife's glance of inquiry. "Has
Lesley told you nothing about our Sunday meetings at the
Club? We generally betake ourselves to North London
on a Sunday afternoon. Mr. Kenyon thinks I had better
stay with you, and&mdash;I don't."</p>

<p>From Maurice's uncomfortable looks, Lady Alice gathered
that there was something doubtful in the proceeding. "Will
you let me go with you?" she said, by way of experiment.</p>

<p>There was an exchange of astonished and rather em<a name="Page_315"></a>barrassed
looks all round. Caspar elevated his eyebrows
and clutched his beard: Miss Brooke made a curious
sound, something like a snort; and Maurice flushed a deep
and dusky red; indications which all annoyed Lady Alice,
although she did not quite know what they signified. She
rose from her chair and took the matter into her own
hands; but all without the slightest change in the manner
of graceful indifference which had grown natural to her of
late years.</p>

<p>"That is the place where Lesley used to go," she said.
"She tells me she sings to the people sometimes. I cannot
sing, but I can play the piano a little, if that is any
good. Sophy is going, is she not? And I should like to
go too."</p>

<p>"There is no reason why you should not," said Mr.
Brooke rather abruptly. But the gleam in his eye told of
pleasure. "There are some very rough characters at the
club sometimes, you know. And perhaps the reception
they give me to-day will not be of the pleasantest."</p>

<p>Lady Alice looked at her husband with a mixture of
wonder and admiration. The calm way in which he sometimes
alluded to his present circumstances, without a trace
of bitterness or fretfulness, amazed her. In old days
she would have put it down to "good breeding&mdash;good
manners," some superficial veneer of good society of which
she thoroughly approved; but she had seen too much of
the seamy side of "good society" now to be able to
accept this explanation of his calmness. It was not want
of sensitiveness, she was sure of that: he was by no means
obtuse: it was simply that his large, strong nature rose
above the pettiness of resentment and complaint. The
suspicion under which he labored was a grave thing&mdash;a
trouble, a blow; but it had not made him sour, nor borne
him to the earth with a conviction of the injustice of mankind.</p>

<p>His wife looked and marveled, but recollected herself in
time to say after only a minute's hesitation:</p>

<p>"I know a little more about rough characters than I once
did. We saw a good many at the East End hospital, did
we not, Mr. Kenyon?"</p>

<p>It was the first time that she had shown that she remembered
Maurice's face. Caspar pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> at a hospital, Alice? Why, what were you doing
there?"<a name="Page_316"></a></p>

<p>"Visiting some of the patients," she answered, with a
little blush.</p>

<p>"Visits which were much appreciated," put in Maurice,
"although we found that Lady Alice was too generous."</p>

<p>"Until I was warned by one of the patients that the
others abused my kindness and traded on it," said Lady
Alice, laughing rather nervously, "and then I drew in a
little."</p>

<p>"What patient was that?"</p>

<p>"The name I think was Smith&mdash;the man who lost his
memory in that curious way."</p>

<p>"Ah yes, I remember." And then Maurice knitted his
brows and became very thoughtful: he looked as if a
thoroughly new idea had been suggested to him.</p>

<p>Miss Brooke remarked that it was almost time to set out
if they were to go to the club that afternoon, and Lady
Alice went to her room for her cloak. She was before the
looking-glass, apparently studying the reflection of her own
face, when a knock at the door, to which she absently said
"Come in," was followed by Caspar's entrance. She,
thinking that it was her maid, did not look round, and he
came behind her without being perceived. The first token
of his presence was received by her when his arm was
slipped round her waist, and his voice said caressingly and
almost playfully in her ear, "I don't know that I want my
dainty piece of china carried down into the slums."</p>

<p>"Am I nothing more to you than that?" said Lady Alice
reproachfully.</p>

<p>He made no answer, but as he looked at the fair face in
the glass, and as their eyes met, she thought that she read
a reply in his glance.</p>

<p>"I have been nothing more&mdash;I know," she said, with
sudden humbleness, "but if it is not too late&mdash;if I can make
up now for the time I have lost&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The tears trembled in her eyes, but he kissed them away
with new tenderness, saying in a soothing tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"We will see, my dear, we will see. I was only in
jest."</p>

<p>And she felt that he was thinking not only of the lost
years, but of the possible gulf before him&mdash;that horror of
darkness and disgrace which they might yet have to face.</p>

<p>She went downstairs to the cab that was waiting, with a
new and subduing sensation very present to her mind: a<a name="Page_317"></a>
sense of something missed out of her own life, a sense of
having failed in the duty that had once been given her to
do. Hitherto she had been buoyed up by a certain confidence
in her own conscientiousness and power of judgment,
as most rather narrow-minded women are; but it now
occurred to her that she might have been wrong&mdash;not only
in a few details, as she had consented to admit&mdash;but wrong
from beginning to end. She had marred not only her own
life but the lives of her husband and her child.</p>

<p>This consciousness kept her very quiet during the drive
to Macclesfield Buildings. But nobody spoke much, except
Doctor Sophy, who made interjectional remarks, half
lost in the rattling of the cab, by way of trying to keep up
everybody's spirits. Caspar sitting opposite his wife, with
his arms folded and his long legs carefully tucked out of
the way, had an unusually serious and even anxious expression.
Indeed it struck Lady Alice for the first time that he
was looking haggard and ill. The burden was weighing
upon him even more than he knew. Maurice, too, seemed
absorbed in thought, so that the drive was not a particularly
lively one.</p>

<p>They got out at the block of buildings which had once
struck Lesley as so particularly ugly. Perhaps their ugliness
did not impress Lady Alice so much. At any rate
she made no remark upon it. Her fingers were lightly
pressed upon Caspar's arm: her thoughts were occupied
by him.</p>

<p>At the door of the block in which the club-rooms were
situated, a little group of men were standing in somewhat
aimless fashion, smoking and talking among themselves.
Caspar recognized several of the club members in this
group. "Ah," he said quietly to his wife, "they thought
that I should not come." She made no answer: as a matter
of fact she began to feel a trifle frightened. These
rough-looking men, with their pipes, who nudged each other
and laughed as she passed, were of a kind unknown to her.
But Caspar walked through them easily, nodding here and
there, with a cheery "Good-afternoon."</p>

<p>Lady Alice did not know it, but the room presented an
unusual sight to her husband's eyes that afternoon. The
fire was burning, and the gas was lighted, for the day was
cold and damp: the comfortable red-seated chairs were as
inviting as ever, and the magazines and newspapers lay in<a name="Page_318"></a>
rows upon the scarlet table-cloth. There were flowers in
the vases, and a piece of music on the open piano. Lady
Alice exclaimed in her pleasure, "How pretty it is! how
cosy!" and wondered at the gloom that sat upon her husband's
brow.</p>

<p>The room was cosy and pretty enough&mdash;but it was empty.</p>

<p>Caspar looked round mutely, then glanced at his companions.
Miss Brooke paused in the act of taking off one
woollen glove, and opened her mouth and forgot to shut it
again. Maurice stood frowning, twitching his brows and
biting his lips in the effort to subdue a torrent of rage that
was surging up in his heart. He would have sworn, he
said afterwards, if Lady Alice had not been there&mdash;he did
not mind Doctor Sophy so much. All that he did now,
however, was to mutter "Ungrateful rascals," and make
as if he would turn to flee.</p>

<p>But he was stopped by Caspar's clutch at his arm. Maurice
saw that his purpose&mdash;that of haranguing the men
outside&mdash;had been divined and arrested. He turned to
his friend and saw for the first time on Caspar's face that
the shaft had gone home. He had shown scarcely any sign
of suffering before.</p>

<p>"I don't deserve this from them," said Brooke quietly,
and Maurice could tell that he had gone rather white about
the lips. Then in a still lower voice, "Don't let her know.
You were right, Maurice; I had better not have come."</p>

<p>"I'll just go and look outside: I won't speak to them,
don't be afraid&mdash;you talk to Lady Alice," said Maurice
breaking from him. But when he got into the dark little
entry, he did not look outside for anything or anybody: he
only relieved himself by exclaiming. "Oh, d&mdash;n the fools!"
and shaking his first in a very reprehensible way at some
imaginary crowd of auditors. For Maurice was half an
Irishman, and his blood was up, and on his friend's behalf
he was, as he would just then have expressed it, "in a devil
of a rage." While he was executing a sort of mad war-dance
on the jute mat in the passage, relieving his mind by
some wild gesticulation and still wilder objurgation of
the world, Mr. Brooke had turned back to his wife with a
pleasant word and smile.</p>

<p>"I must show you the photographs," he said. "We are
very proud of them. There will be plenty of time, for the
members seem to be a little late in getting together to-day.
Possibly they thought I was not coming."<a name="Page_319"></a></p>

<p>"It is scarcely time yet," said Miss Brooke heroically.
She knew it was ten minutes past, but she was quite prepared
to sacrifice truth for the maintenance of her brother's
dignity.</p>

<p>"That's a good one of the Parthenon," said Caspar
negligently, putting his hand within his wife's arm, and
leading her from one picture to another. "The Coliseum
you see: not quite so clear as it might be. These frames
were made by one of the men in the buildings&mdash;given as a
present to the club. Not bad taste, are they? And this
statuette&mdash;&mdash;".</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly. He had been going on hurriedly
and feverishly, filling up the time as best he might, trying
to forget the embarrassing situation into which he had
brought his wife and himself, when the sound of heavy
footsteps fell upon his ear. A sound of shuffling, the creak
of men's boots, a little gruff whispering in the doorway&mdash;what
was it all about? Were the men whom he had helped
and guided going to turn against him openly&mdash;to give
him in his wife's presence some other insult beside the tacit
insult of their absence? He turned round sharply, with the
feeling that if he was brought to bay the men would have
a bad time of it. He certainly looked a formidable antagonist.
The hair had fallen over his forehead, his brows were
knotted, his eyes gleamed rather fiercely beneath them, his
under lip was thrust out aggressively. "As fierce as a lion,"
said one of the observers, afterwards. But even while his
eyes darted flame and fury at the men who had deserted
them, his body kept its half-protecting, half-deferential pose
with respect to Lady Alice; and the hand that held her arm
was studiously gentle in its touch.</p>

<p>Lady Alice turned round, amazed. There was a little
crowd in the passage: the room was already half full.
Men and women too were there, and more crowded in from
behind. There must have been nearly fifty, when all were
seen, and there were more men than women. But they
did not sit down: they stood, they leaned against the walls;
one or two mounted on the benches at the back and stood
where they could get a good view of the proceedings. Caspar's
scowl remained fixed, but it was a scowl of astonishment.
He looked round for Maurice, whom he presently
saw beckoning to him to take his usual place near the
piano. He said a word to his wife, and brought her round<a name="Page_320"></a>
with him towards his sister and his friend. The men still
stood, and crowded a little nearer to him as he reached his
place. There was very little talking in the room, and the
men's faces looked somewhat solemn: it was evidently a
serious occasion.</p>

<p>"Is this&mdash;this&mdash;what usually goes on?" queried the
puzzled Lady Alice.</p>

<p>"This? Oh no!" said Maurice, to whom she had addressed
herself, with a sudden happy laugh, and a perfectly
beaming face. "<i>This</i> is&mdash;a demonstration. Here, Caspar,
old man, you've got to stand here. <i>Now</i>, Gregson."</p>

<p>Lady Alice accepted the chair offered to her, and Miss
Brooke another. Caspar began to look utterly perplexed,
but a little relieved also, for his eye, in straying over the
crowd, had recognized two or three faces as those of intimate
friends who seemed to be mingling with the men, and
he felt sure that they had no inimical purpose towards him.
All that he could do was to look down and grasp his
beard, as usual, while Jim Gregson, the man who had once
spoken to Lesley so warmly of her father, being pushed
forward by the crowd as their spokesman, addressed himself
to Caspar.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brooke&mdash;Sir: We have made bold to change the
order of the proceedings for this 'ere afternoon. Instead of
beginning with the music, we just want to say a few words;
and that's why we've come in all at once, so as to show that
we are all of one mind. We think, sir, that this is a very suitable
opportunity for presenting you with a mark of our&mdash;our
gratitude and esteem. We have always found you a true
friend to us, and an upright man that would never allow
the weak to be trampled on, nor the poor to be oppressed,
and we wish to show that whatever the newspapers may
say, sir, we have got heads on our shoulders and know a
good man when we see him." This sentence was uttered
with great emphasis, to an accompaniment of "Hear, hear,"
from the audience, and considerable stamping of feet, umbrellas
and sticks. "What we wish to say, sir," and Mr.
Gregson became more and more embarrassed as he came
to this point, "is that we respect you as a man and as a
gentleman, and that we take this opportunity of asking you
to accept this small tribute of our feelings towards you,
and we wish to say that there's not a member of the club
as has not contributed his mite towards it, as well as many<a name="Page_321"></a>
poor neighbors in the Buildings. It's a small thing to give,
but that you will excuse on account of the shortness of the
notice, so to speak: the suggestion having been made
amongst ourselves and by ourselves only three days ago.
We beg you'll accept it as a token of respect, sir, from the
whole of the Macclesfield Buildings Working Men's Club,
of which you was the founder, and which we hope you'll continue
for many long years to be the president <i>of</i>." And with
a resounding emphasis on the preposition, Mr. Gregson
finished his speech. A tremendous salvo of applause followed
his last word, and before it had died away a woman
was hastily dragged to the front, with a child&mdash;a blue-eyed
fairy of two or three years old&mdash;in her arms. The child held
a brown paper parcel, and presented it with baby solemnity
to Mr. Brooke, who kissed her as he took it from her
hands. And then, under cover of more deafening applause,
Mr. Brooke turned hurriedly to Maurice and said, in a very
unheroic manner&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, I can't stand much more of this. I shall make
a fool of myself directly."</p>

<p>"Do: they'll like it, the beggars!" returned Maurice
in high glee.</p>

<p>But he had more sympathy in his eyes than his words
expressed, and the grip that he gave his friend's hand set the
audience once more applauding enthusiastically. An audience
of Londoners with whom a speaker is in touch, is one
of the most sympathetic and enthusiastic in the world.</p>

<p>While they applauded, the parcel was opened. It contained
a morocco case, lined with dark blue satin and velvet&mdash;an
unromantic and prosaic expression of as truly high and
noble feeling as ever found a vent in more poetic ways&mdash;and
on the velvet cushion lay&mdash;twelve silver spoons!</p>

<p>There was an odd little touch of bathos about it, and an
outsider might perhaps have smiled at the way in which
the British workman and his wife had chosen to manifest
their faith in the man who had been in their eyes wrongfully
accused; but nobody present in the little assembly
saw the humorous side of it at all, not even a young gentleman
who was hastily making a sketch of it for the
<i>Graphic</i>, for he blew his nose as vigorously as anybody
else. And there was a good display of handkerchiefs and
some rather troublesome coughing and choking in the
course of the afternoon, which showed that the donors of<a name="Page_322"></a>
the spoons did not look on the gift exactly in the light of a
joke.</p>

<p>Mr. Brooke was a practised speaker; and when he
opened his lips to reply, his sister dried her eyes and put
down her handkerchief with a gratified smile as much as
to say, "Now we shall have a treat." And she settled herself
so that she could watch the effect of the speech on
Lady Alice, who had forgotten to wipe her tears away, and
sat with eyelashes wet and cheeks slightly flushed, looking
astoundingly young and pretty in the excitement of the
moment. But Miss Brooke was doomed to be disappointed.
Caspar began once, twice, thrice&mdash;and broke down irrevocably.
The only intelligible words he got out were, "My
dear friends, I can't tell you how I thank you." And that
was quite true: he couldn't.</p>

<p>But there was all the more applause, and all the more
kindly feeling for that failure of his to make a speech; and
then one or two other men spoke of the good that Mr.
Brooke had done in that neighborhood, and of the help that
he had given them all in founding the club, and of the brave
and encouraging words that he had spoken to them, and so
on; and the young artist for the <i>Graphic</i> sketched away
faster and faster, and said to himself, "My eye, there'll be
a precious row if they try to hang him after this, whatever
he's done." But the sensation of the afternoon was yet to
come.</p>

<p>"I can only say once more, my friends," said Caspar, as
the hour wore away, "that I thank you for this expression
of your confidence in me, and that I have never had a
prouder moment in my life than this, in which you tell me
of your own accord that you believe in my innocence of
the crime attributed to me. Of that, however, I will not
speak. I wish only, before we separate, to introduce you
to my wife, who has never been here before, and whom I
am sure you will welcome for my sake."</p>

<p>There was a moment of astonishment. Every one knew
something of the story of Caspar's married life, and was
taken aback by the appearance of his wife. But when
Maurice Kenyon led the way by clapping his hands vigorously,
someone took up the word, and cried, "Three cheers
for Mrs. Brooke." And Lady Alice started at the new
title, and thought that it sounded much better than the one
by which she was usually known.<a name="Page_323"></a></p>

<p>"Shall I say any more?" said Caspar, smiling as he
stooped down to her. But suddenly she rose to her feet
and put her hand within his arm. "No," she said, "I am
going to do it myself."</p>

<p>The storm of clapping was renewed and died away when
it was perceived that Lady Alice was about to speak. She
was a little flushed, but perfectly self-possessed, and her
clear silvery voice could be heard in every corner of the
room.</p>

<p>"I wish to thank you, too," she said, "for your kindness
to my husband and myself. I hope I shall know more of
his work here by and by, and in the meantime I can only
tell you that you are right to trust him and believe in him&mdash;as
<i>I</i> trust him and believe in him with all my heart and
soul!"</p>

<p>She turned to him a little as she spoke, her eyes shining,
her face transfigured&mdash;the faith in her making itself
manifest in feature and in gesture alike. There was not
applause so much as a murmur of assent when she had
done; and Caspar, laying hold of her hand, looked down
at her with a new warmth of tenderness, and said half
wonderingly,</p>

<p>"Why, Alice!"</p>

<p>"Do you think I could let them go without telling them
what you are to me?" she said, with a kind of passion in
her voice which reminded him of Lesley. But there was
no time to say more, for every person in the room presented
himself or herself to shake hands with Caspar and
his wife, and to admire the spoons, which had been purchased
only the night before.</p>

<p>"Very glad to see you amongst us, Mrs. Brooke, mum;
and hope you'll come again," was heard so often that Lady
Alice was quite amazed by the warmth of the greeting.
"And the young lady too&mdash;where's she? she ought to
have been here as well," said one woman; to which Maurice
Kenyon responded in a pleased growl&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, confound your blundering, so she ought; and so
she would have been, if you hadn't nearly made such a
blessed mull of the whole affair."</p>

<p>He did not think that anybody heard him, and was
rather taken aback when Lady Alice smiled at him over
her shoulder. "What do you mean, Mr. Kenyon?" she
said.<a name="Page_324"></a></p>

<p>Maurice was on his good behavior immediately. "Oh,
nothing, Lady Alice; only that Miss Brooke might have
been here if we had only had a hint beforehand, and it is
a pity she should have missed it."</p>

<p>"A great pity," said Lesley's mother; and she looked
quite complacently at the twelve silver spoons, which she
was guarding so jealously, as if she feared they would be
taken away from her.</p>

<p>Outside the doors, when the assembly had reluctantly
dispersed, after an improvised collation, given by Caspar,
of hot drinks and plum cake, a little crowd of men and
boys cheered the departing hero of the day so valiantly
that Lady Alice was almost glad to find herself once more
driving through the dusky London streets with her husband
at her side. Miss Brooke and Maurice had elected
to walk home.</p>

<p>"There's one thing," said Caspar, rather later in the day,
as a history of these experiences was unfolded to Lesley;
"we quite, forgot to tell the good folks your mother's name
and title. She was applauded to the echo as 'Mrs. Brooke.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, you must never tell them," said Lady Alice,
hastily. "I do not want to be anything else, please&mdash;now."</p>

<p>"I wish they had let one know beforehand," said Maurice,
"they kept it a dead secret&mdash;even from me."</p>

<p>"All the greater surprise for us," said Mr. Brooke. Then
he looked at Maurice for a moment, and smiled. But it was
long before they mentioned to each other what both had
thought and felt in that heart-breaking minute of suspense
when they believed that Caspar was deserted in the hour of
need.</p>

<p>"Well," said Caspar Brooke, at length, "whatever may
happen now"&mdash;and he made a pause which was fraught
with graver meaning than he would have cared to put into
words&mdash;"I can feel at any rate that 'I have had my say.'
And you, Alice&mdash;well, my dear, you will always have those
silver spoons to look at! So we have not done badly after
all."</p>

<p>Like Sir Thomas More, he would have joked when going
to the scaffold; but jokes under such circumstances have
rather a ghastly sound in the ears of his family.<a name="Page_325"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL"></a>CHAPTER XL.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">CAIN.</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">Maurice Kenyon</span> took an early opportunity of asking
Lady Alice whether she would recognize the man Smith if
she saw him again.</p>

<p>"I think so. Why do you ask? You know I talked to
him a good deal."</p>

<p>"I have been very blind," said Maurice seriously. "I
never thought until to-day of associating him in my mind
with someone else&mdash;someone whom I have seen twice
during the past week. May I speak freely to you? You
know I am as anxious as anyone can possibly be that this
mystery should be cleared up. I wish to speak of Francis
Trent, the brother of Oliver Trent, and the husband of the
woman who makes this accusation against Mr. Brooke."</p>

<p>Lady Alice recoiled. "You cannot mean that John
Smith had anything to do with him?"</p>

<p>"I have a strong belief that John Smith and Francis
Trent are one and the same. To my shame be it spoken,
I did not recognize him either on Wednesday or Friday
when I paid him a visit. Ethel wished me to go when she
heard that he was ill." He said this in a deprecating
tone.</p>

<p>"I quite understand. You saw this man&mdash;Francis Trent&mdash;then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and could not imagine where I had seen him
before. I think it is the man I used to see in hospital.
Lady Alice&mdash;if you saw him yourself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I, Mr. Kenyon? What! see the man and woman who
accuse my husband of murder?"&mdash;There was genuine
horror in her tone. "How could I speak to them?"</p>

<p>"It is just a chance," said Maurice, in a low voice. "If
he knew that <i>you</i> were the wife of the man who was accused&mdash;perhaps
something would come of it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"<a name="Page_326"></a></p>

<p>"Lady Alice, pray do not build too much on what I am
going to say. If Francis Trent and John Smith be the
same, then my knowledge of John Smith's previous condition
leads me to think it quite possible that it was Francis
Trent who, in a fit of frenzy, committed the murder of
which your husband is suspected."</p>

<p>Lady Alice looked at him in silence. "I don't see
exactly," she said, "that I should be of much use."</p>

<p>"Nor I&mdash;exactly," said Maurice. "But I see a vague
chance; and I ask you&mdash;for your husband's sake&mdash;to try
it."</p>

<p>"Ah, you know I cannot refuse that," she said quickly.
And then she arranged with him where they should meet
on the following afternoon in order to drive to the lodgings
now occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Francis Trent. Whether this
proceeding might not be stigmatized as "tampering with
witnesses," Maurice and Lady Alice neither knew nor
cared. If Maurice had a doubt, he stifled it by telling himself
that they were not going to visit the "witness," Mary
Trent, but the sick man, John Smith, in whom Lady Alice
had been interested at the hospital. It was only as a precaution
that he took with him young Mr. Grierson, junior
partner of the firm of solicitors to whom Caspar's defence
was entrusted. Young Grierson was a friend as well as a
lawyer, and it was always as well to have a friend at hand.
But really he hardly knew for what result he hoped.</p>

<p>The rooms in which Maurice himself, at Ethel's instance,
had located Mr. and Mrs. Francis Trent were in Bernard
Street. They were plain but apparently clean and comfortable.
Maurice said a word to the servant, and unceremoniously
put her aside, and walked straight into the room
where he knew that Francis Trent was lying.</p>

<p>A thin, spare woman, with a deadly pale face and black
sunken eyes, rose from a seat beside the bed as they
entered. Lady Alice knew, as if by instinct, that this was
Mary Trent. She averted her eyes from the woman who
had falsely accused her husband: she could not bear to
look at her. But Mary Trent scarcely took her eyes off
Lady Alice's face.</p>

<p>"Will you look here, Lady Alice, if you please?" said
Maurice in his most professional tone. She turned towards
the bed, and saw&mdash;yes, it was the face of the man whom
she had known in the hospital: thinner, yellower, more<a name="Page_327"></a>
haggard than ever, but still the face of the patient who used
to watch her as if her presence were a means of healing in
itself.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said slowly, "that is&mdash;John Smith."</p>

<p>"His real name is Francis Trent," said Maurice. "Do
you know this lady, Francis?"</p>

<p>The sick man nodded. There was a curiously vacant
look upon his face, brightened only at times by gleams of
vivid consciousness.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know her. The lady that came to see me
in hospital," he murmured feebly.</p>

<p>"Do you know who she is?"</p>

<p>"Why do you trouble him, sir?" said Mrs. Trent.
"You see how ill he is, wouldn't it be better for him to be
left in peace?"</p>

<p>She spoke with sedulous calmness; but there was a jar
in her voice which did not sound quite natural. Maurice
simply repeated his question, and Francis Trent shook his
head.</p>

<p>"She is the wife of Caspar Brooke, the man who, you
<i>say</i>, killed your brother Oliver."</p>

<p>The sick man's eyes dilated, and fixed themselves uneasily
on his wife. "I did not say it," he answered, almost
in a whisper. "Mary said it&mdash;not I."</p>

<p>"But you heard something, did you not?" said Maurice
remorselessly.</p>

<p>"How should he hear anything," said Mary Trent, "and
he asleep in his bed at the time? Or if not asleep, too ill
and weak to notice anything. It's a shame to question him
like that; and not legal, neither. You'll please to leave us
to ourselves, sir; we ain't a show. We can but say what
we saw and heard, whatever the consequences may be, but
we need not be tortured for all that."</p>

<p>"That's enough, Mary," said the man speaking from the
bed in a much more natural manner and in a stronger
voice than he had yet used. "You're overdoing it&mdash;you
always do. It's no good. This is the last stroke, and I
give up. It has gone against the grain with me to get
anybody into trouble," he said, looking attentively at Lady
Alice, "and now that I know who this lady is, I don't feel
inclined to keep up the farce any longer. I am much too
ill to live to be hanged&mdash;Mr. Kenyon can tell you so at any
minute&mdash;and I may as well give you the satisfaction of<a name="Page_328"></a>
knowing that Caspar Brooke had nothing at all to do with
Oliver's death: I was his murderer, and no one else: I
swear it, so help me God!"</p>

<p>Lady Alice turned very faint. Someone put her in a
chair and fanned her, and when she came to herself she
heard Francis Trent's wife speaking.</p>

<p>"He's mad, I tell you. It's no good paying any attention
to what he says, gentlemen. I saw him myself in his
bed at the time, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, Mary, my dear good soul," said Francis with the
old easy superiority which he had always assumed to her,
"will you just hold your tongue, and let me tell my own
tale? You have done your best for me, but you know I
always told you I was not to be trusted to lie about it if
anybody appealed to me to evidence. I really have not
the strength to keep it up. I want at least to die like a
gentleman."</p>

<p>"I am not at all sure that you are going to die," said
Maurice quietly, with his finger on the sick man's pulse.
Francis had put off the vacant expression, and his eyes had
lighted up. He was evidently quite himself again.</p>

<p>"No?" he said easily. "Well, I would rather die, if it's
all the same to you; because I fancy I shall have to be
put under restraint if I do live. I don't always know what
I am doing in the least. I know now, though. You can
bear me out, doctor, isn't my brain in a very queer state?"</p>

<p>"I fear it is," said Maurice.</p>

<p>"Just so. I am subject to fits of rage in which I don't
know what I am doing. And on that night when Oliver
came to see me, after Brooke had gone away, I got into one
of these frenzies and followed him downstairs, picking up
Brooke's stick on the way and beating poor Oliver about
the head with it.... You know well enough how he was
found. I only came to myself when it was done. And
then, my wife&mdash;with all a woman's ingenuity&mdash;bundled me
into bed, swore that I had never left it, and that Caspar
Brooke had done it. It was a lie&mdash;she told me so afterwards.
Eh, Mary?&mdash;Forgive me, old girl: I've got you
into trouble now; but that is better than letting an innocent
man swing for what I have done, especially when that
man is the husband of one who was so kind to me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the father of Lesley Brooke," said Maurice, looking
steadfastly at Mary Trent.<a name="Page_329"></a></p>
<p>A shudder ran through the woman's frame. Then she
covered her face with her hands and flung herself down at
her husband's side.</p>

<p>"Oh Francis, my dear, my dear!" she said. "I did it
for you."</p>

<p>And then for an instant there was silence in the room,
save for her heavy sobs. Francis lay still but patted her
with his thin fingers, and looked at Caspar Brooke's wife
with his large, unnaturally bright, dark eyes.</p>

<p>"She is a good soul in spite of it all," he said, addressing
himself to Lady Alice. "And she did it out of love
for me. You would have done as much for your husband,
perhaps, if you loved him&mdash;but I have heard, that you
don't."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you are wrong," said Lady Alice. "I love him
with all my heart, and I thank you deeply&mdash;deeply&mdash;for
saving him."</p>

<p>"That ought to be some payment," said Francis Trent,
with his wan, wild smile. "And I don't suppose they'll
be very hard on me, as I did not know what I was doing.
You'll speak a word to that effect, won't you, doctor?"</p>

<p>"I will indeed. But it would have been better for you
as well as for others if truth had been told from the beginning,"
said Kenyon.</p>

<p>"It can't be helped now. Is there anything else I can
do? You must have my statement taken down. And
Mary, my girl, you'll have to make your confession too."</p>

<p>"Oh, Francis, Francis!" she moaned. "Not against
you, my dear&mdash;not against you!"</p>

<p>"Yes, against me," said Francis steadily. "And let us
finish with the formalities as quickly as may be, doctor, as
long as my head's clear. I killed my brother Oliver&mdash;that
you must make known as soon as you can. Not for malice,
poor chap, nor yet for money&mdash;though he had cheated me
many a time&mdash;but because I was mad&mdash;mad. And I am
mad now&mdash;mad though you do not know it&mdash;stark, staring
mad!"</p>

<p>And his dark eyes glared at them so strangely that Lady
Alice cried out and had to be led into another room, for it
was the light of madness indeed that shone from beneath
his sunken brows.</p>

<p>It was while she sat alone for a minute or two while the
gentlemen were talking in another room, that Mary Trent<a name="Page_330"></a>
came creeping to her, with folded hands and furtive mien.</p>

<p>"Oh, my lady, my lady, forgive me," she said, sobbing
fretfully as she spoke. "I thought but of my own&mdash;I did
not think of you. Nor of Miss Lesley, though I did love
her&mdash;yes, I did, and tried my best to save her from that
wicked man. Mr. Brooke will tell you what I mean,
ma'am. And tell him, if you will be so good, that I was
frightened into taking back the stories I had told him
about Oliver&mdash;but they were <i>all true</i>. Everyone of 'em
was true. And that I beg he'll forgive me; for a better
and a kinder gentleman I never see, nor one that loved
poor people more. And Miss Lesley was just like him&mdash;but
it was my husband, and I thought he'd be hanged for
it, and what could I do?"</p>

<p>And then, while Lady Alice still hesitated between pity
and a feeling of revolt at pity for a woman who had
sworn falsely against her dearly beloved husband, Caspar
Brooke, a cry was heard from the bedroom, and Mary
turned and fled back to the scene of her duties&mdash;sad and
painful duties indeed, sometimes, when the madman became
violent, and likely enough to be very speedily terminated
by death.</p>

<hr style="visibility: hidden; margin: 1em;">


<p>"What can I say to you?" said Lady Alice to Maurice
Kenyon, a day or two later. "It was your acuteness that
brought the matter to light. Now that that poor wretched
man is hopelessly insane, we might never have learnt the
truth. Is there any way in which I can thank you? any
way in which I can give you a reward?"</p>

<p>She looked steadily into his face, and saw that he
changed color.</p>

<p>"There is only one way, Lady Alice," he stammered.</p>

<p>"You are not to call me Lady Alice: I like 'Mrs.
Brooke' much better. Well?"</p>

<p>"I love your daughter," said Maurice bluntly, "and I
believe she would love me if you would let her."</p>

<p>"<i>Let</i> her?" said Mrs. Brooke, with a smile.</p>

<p>"She made you some promises before she came to London&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, not to become engaged before the year was out.
Tell her that I absolve her from that promise, and&mdash;ask
her again."</p>

<p>Maurice found that under these conditions Lesley's
answer was all that could be desired.<a name="Page_331"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI"></a>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">VALE!</p>


<p><span class="firstwords">"Now</span> that Ethel has gone to the sea-side, I can have you
to myself a little while," said Lady Alice to her daughter.</p>

<p>"Poor Ethel! But it is delightful to have you here,
mamma: it is so home-like and comfortable."</p>

<p>"Ah, you will soon have to make a home for somebody
else!"</p>

<p>Lesley grew red, but smiled. "We won't think of that
yet," she said softly. "Mamma, I want to speak to you
on a very serious subject."</p>

<p>"Well, my darling?"</p>

<p>"You won't be angry with me, will you? It is&mdash;about
Mrs. Romaine."</p>

<p>Lady Alice's brow clouded a little. "Well, Lesley?"
she said.</p>

<p>"Mamma, I can't bear Mrs. Romaine myself. Neither
can you. Neither can papa. And it is very unchristian
of all of us, to say the least. Because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Neither can papa," repeated Lady Alice, with raised
brows. "My dear child, Mrs. Romaine is a great friend
of your father's. He told me only the other day that she
used to come here very often&mdash;to see your Aunt Sophy
and yourself."</p>

<p>"So she did," said Lesley, lightly. "But, of course,
she can't very well come now&mdash;at least, it would be awkward.
Still I am sure papa does not like her, for he
looked quite pleased the other day when I told him that
she was going to give up her house, and said in his short
way&mdash;'So much the better.'"</p>

<p>"Very slight evidence," said Caspar Brooke's wife
smiling.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind evidence, mammy dear. What I
want to say is that I feel very sorry for Mrs. Romaine.
You see she must be feeling very much alone in the world.
Oliver, whom she really cared for, is dead, and Francis is<a name="Page_332"></a>
out of his mind, and Francis' wife"&mdash;with a little shudder&mdash;"cannot
be anything to her&mdash;and then, don't you think,
mamma, that when there has been <i>one</i> case of insanity in
the family, she must be afraid of herself too?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. Francis Trent's insanity was the
result of an accident."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it is very saddening for her, all the same, and
she must be terribly lonely in that house in Russell Square.
I wanted to know if I might go and call upon her?"</p>

<p>"You, dear? I thought you did not like her."</p>

<p>"I don't," said Lesley, frankly, "but I am sorry for
her. Ethel asked me why I did not go. She thought
there must be something wrong, because Rosalind never
came to see her after Oliver's death&mdash;never once. I believe
she has scarcely been out of the house&mdash;not at all
since the funeral, and that is a month ago. I have not
heard that she was ill, so I suppose it is just that she is&mdash;miserable,
poor thing."</p>

<p>Lady Alice stroked her daughter's hair in silence for a
minute or two. "I think I had better go instead of you,
Lesley. There is no reason why she should feel she cannot
see us. She was not to blame for that accusation&mdash;though
I heard that she believed it. But I will see her
first, and you can go afterwards if she is able to receive
visitors."</p>

<p>"That is very good of you, mamma&mdash;especially as you
don't like her," said Lesley. "I can't help feeling thankful
that Ethel will have nothing to do with that family
now. And since Maurice told her a little more about poor
Mr. Trent, I think she sees that she would not have been
very happy." She was silent for a little while, and then
went on, trying to give an indifferent sound to her words:&mdash;"Captain
Duchesne's people live near Eastbourne, he told
me; and Ethel has gone to Seaford."</p>

<p>"Not far off," said Lady Alice, smiling a little. "I hope
that his sister Margaret will call on Ethel: I think they
would like each other."</p>

<p>And no more was said, for it was as yet too early
to wonder even whether Harry Duchesne's adoration
for Ethel Kenyon was ultimately to meet with a return.</p>

<p>True to her new tastes, Lady Alice had had cards
printed bearing the name "Mrs. Caspar Brooke." She
desired, she said, to be identified with her husband as<a name="Page_333"></a>
much as possible: it was a great mistake to retain a mere
courtesy title, as if she had interests and station remote
from those of her husband. Caspar had smilingly opposed
this change, but Lady Alice had stood firm. Indeed, to
her old friends she remained "Lady Alice" to the end of
the chapter; but to the outer world she was henceforth
known as Mrs. Brooke.</p>

<p>She sent up one of her new cards when she called upon
Mrs. Romaine. She paid this visit with considerable
shrinking of heart. She had bitter memories connected
with Mrs. Romaine. Since the day on which she had
been reconciled to her husband, she had cast from her all
suspicion of his past&mdash;cast it from her in much the same
arbitrary and unreasoning manner as she had first embraced
it. For, like most women, she was governed far more by her
feelings and instincts than by the laws of evidence. As
Rosalind had once told her brother, Lady Alice had accidentally
seen and intercepted a letter of hers to Caspar;
and Lady Alice had then rushed to the conclusion that it
was part of a long continued correspondence and not a
single communication. And now&mdash;now&mdash;&mdash;what did she
think? She hardly knew; of one thing only was she certain
that Caspar had never been untrue to her, had never cared
for any woman but herself.</p>

<p>She was not at all sure that Mrs. Romaine would receive
her: she knew that she had written to her in a tone that
no woman, especially a woman like Mrs. Romaine, is likely
to forgive; but time, she thought, blunts the memory of
past injuries, and if Rosalind chose to forget the past, she
would forget it too. It was with a soft and kindly feeling,
therefore, that Lady Alice asked for admittance at Mrs.
Romaine's door, and learned that Mrs. Romaine was at
home and would see her.</p>

<p>Before she had been in the drawing-room five minutes,
it dawned on Lady Alice's mind that there was something
odd in her hostess' manner and even in her appearance.
Of course she was prepared for a change; in the twelve
years or more that had elapsed since they had met she herself
must have also changed. But, as a matter of fact,
Lady Alice's long, elegant figure, shining hair and delicate
complexion showed the ravages of time far less distinctly
than she imagined; while Mrs. Romaine was a mere wreck
of what she had been in her youth. During the last few<a name="Page_334"></a>
weeks, Rosalind had grown thin: her features were sharpened,
her hands white and wasted: her eyes seemed too
large for her face, and were surmounted by dark and heavy
shadows. Lady Alice was reminded of another face that
she had last seen relieved against the whiteness of a pillow,
of eyes that had gleamed wildly as they looked at her, of a
certain oddness of expression that in her own heart she
called "a mad look." Yes, there was certainly a likeness
between her and her brother Francis, and it was the sort
of likeness that gave Lady Alice a shock.</p>

<p>For a few minutes the two women talked in platitudes
of indifferent things. Lady Alice noticed that after every
sentence or two Mrs. Romaine let the subject drop and sat
looking at her furtively, as if she expected something that
did not come. Was it sympathy that she wanted? It was
with difficulty that Lady Alice could approach the subject.
After a longer pause than usual, she said softly&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must let me tell you how sorry I am for the sorrow
that has come upon you&mdash;upon us all."</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine stared at her for a moment; an angry
light showed itself in her eyes.</p>

<p>"You have come to tell me that?" she said, with chill
disdain.</p>

<p>"I came to say so&mdash;yes," Lady Alice answered, in her surprise.</p>

<p>"I am very much obliged to you, I am sure." The tone
was almost insolent, but the woman was herself again.
The oddness, the awkwardness of manner had passed away,
and her old grace of bearing had come back. Even her
beauty returned with the flush of crimson to her face and
the lustre of her eyes. The prospect of combat brought
back the animation and the brilliancy that she had lost.</p>

<p>"There were other things I thought that you had perhaps
come to say&mdash;repetitions of what you said to me years ago&mdash;before
you left your husband."</p>

<p>Lady Alice rose at once. "I think you had better not
touch on that subject," she said gently but with dignity. "I
did not come here with any such intention. I hoped all
that was forgotten by you&mdash;as it is by me."</p>

<p>"I have not forgotten," said Mrs. Romaine, rising also,
and fixing her eyes on Lady Alice's face.</p>

<p>"I am sorry for it. You will allow me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, do not go: stay for a minute or two, I beg of you.<a name="Page_335"></a>
I am not well&mdash;I said more than I meant&mdash;do not leave
me just yet." She spoke now hurriedly and entreatingly.</p>

<p>These extraordinary changes of tone and manner impressed
Lady Alice disagreeably. And yet she hesitated:
she did not like to carry out her purpose of leaving the
house at once, when she had been entreated to remain.
Looking at her, Mrs. Romaine seemed to make a great
effort over herself, and suddenly put on the air that she
used most to affect&mdash;the air of a woman of the world, with
peculiarly engaging manners.</p>

<p>"Don't hurry away," she said. "I really have something
particular to say to you. Will you listen to me for
two minutes?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if you wish it."</p>

<p>"I do wish it very much. You will stay? That is kind
of you. And I will ring for tea."</p>

<p>"No, please do not," said Lady Alice shrinking instinctively
from the thought of eating and drinking in Rosalind
Romaine's drawing-room; "I really cannot stay long, and
I do not drink tea so early."</p>

<p>Her hostess smiled and withdrew her hand from the bell-handle.
"As you please," she said indifferently. "It is
so long since I had visitors that I almost forget how to
entertain them. You must excuse me if I have seemed
<i>distrait</i> or&mdash;or peculiar. You see I have had a great deal
to bear."</p>

<p>"I know it, and I am very sorry," said Lady Alice
gently.</p>

<p>"You are very kind." Was there a touch of satire in
the tone? "And&mdash;as you are here&mdash;why should we not
speak of one or two matters that have troubled us sometimes?
As two women of the world, we ought to be able
to come to a sort of compact."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, Mrs. Romaine."</p>

<p>Rosalind laughed a little wildly. "Of course you don't.
But I do not mean to talk conventionalism or commonplace.
Just for a minute or two, let us speak openly. You
have come back to your husband&mdash;yes, I <i>will</i> speak, and
you shall not interrupt!&mdash;and you hope no doubt to be
happy with him. Don't you know that I could wreck your
whole happiness if I chose?"</p>

<p>The color rose in Lady Alice's face, but she looked
clearly into the other's face as she replied<a name="Page_336"></a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"My happiness with my husband is not dependent on
anything that you may do or say. I really cannot discuss
the subject with you, Mrs. Romaine, it is most unsuitable."</p>

<p>"You are very impatient," said Rosalind satirically.
"I only want to make a bargain with you. If you will do
something that I want, I promise you that I will go away
from London and never speak to any of your family again."
Lady Alice's alarm struggled for mastery with her pride
and her sense of the becoming, both of which told her not
to parley with this woman. But the temptation to a
naturally exacting nature was very great. She hesitated for
a moment, and Mrs. Romaine went rapidly on.</p>

<p>"I wrote a letter once." The hot color mounted to her
cheeks and brow while she was speaking. "You wrote to
me about it. But you did not send it back. You have
that letter still."</p>

<p>Lady Alice continued to look at her steadily, but made
no reply.</p>

<p>"That letter has been the curse of my life. I repented
it as soon as it was sent&mdash;you may be sure of that: I could
repeat it word for word even now. Oh, no doubt you made
the most of it&mdash;jeered at it&mdash;laughed over it with <i>him</i>&mdash;but
to me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is the last thing I should ever have mentioned to my
husband," said Lady Alice, with grave disdain. "He
never knew that you wrote it&mdash;never saw it&mdash;never will see
or know it from <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you have kept it to yourself all
these years?"</p>

<p>"I mean that I put it into the fire as soon as I had read
it. Why are you so concerned about it? Was it worse
than the others that you must have written&mdash;before that?"</p>

<p>"I never wrote to him before."</p>

<p>They faced each other with mutual suspicion in their
eyes. Lady Alice had forgotten her proud reserve: she
wanted to know the truth at last.</p>

<p>"I will acknowledge," she said, "that I believed that
you had written other letters&mdash;of a somewhat similar kind&mdash;to
Mr. Brooke. I was angry and disgusted: it was that
which formed one of my reasons for leaving him years ago.
But I have come to a better mind since then. I do not
care what you wrote, what you said, or what you did: I
believe that my husband is a good man and I love him. I<a name="Page_337"></a>
have come back to him, and shall never leave him again.
You can do me no harm now."</p>

<p>Mrs. Romaine laughed mockingly. "Can I not?" she
said. "Do you know that he came to me within an hour
after his release? Do you know that he asked me to go
away with him to Spain, where we could be safe and happy
together? What do you say to that?"</p>

<p>"I say this," cried Lady Alice, almost violently, "that
I do not believe a word of it." She drew herself to her full
height and turned to leave the room. Then she looked at
Rosalind and spoke in a gentler tone. "I am sorry for
you," she said. "But your suffering is partly your own
fault. What right had you to think of winning my husband's
heart away from me? You have not succeeded, although
you have done your best to make us miserable. I have
never spoken of you to him&mdash;never; but now, when I go
home, I shall go straight to him and tell him all that you
have said to me, and I shall know very well whether what
you say is false or true."</p>

<p>She left the room proudly and firmly, unheeding of the
mocking laugh that Rosalind sent after her. She let herself
out into the street and walked straight back to her home.
Caspar was out: she could not go to him immediately, as
she had said that she would do. She went to her room and
lay down upon the bed, feeling strangely tired and weak.
In spite of her haughty rebuttal of the charge against her
husband, she was wounded and oppressed by it. And as
the time went on, she felt more and more the difficulty of
telling him her story, of asking him to clear himself. How
could she question him without seeming to doubt?</p>

<p>She fretted herself until a headache came on, and she
was unable to go down to dinner. Lesley brought her up
a cup of tea, but her mother refused her company. "I
shall be better alone," she said. "Has your father come
in yet? Isn't he very late?"</p>

<p>It was nearly ten o'clock when Mr. Brooke came in, and,
hearing that he had been asked for, made his way to his
wife's room. He bent over her tenderly, asking her how
she felt; and she put one hand up to his rough cheek,
without answering.</p>

<p>"What has made your head ache, my darling?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Caspar, I have been to see Mrs. Romaine."</p>

<p>She felt a sort of start or quiver go through him at the<a name="Page_338"></a>
name. He put his lips softly to her forehead before he
spoke. "Well!" he said, a little dryly.</p>

<p>"Did you&mdash;did she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then she broke down, and sobbed a little with her face
against her husband's breast. Caspar's breath grew shorter&mdash;a
sign of excitement with him&mdash;but for a time he waited
quietly and would not speak. He could not all at once
make up his mind what to say.</p>

<p>"Alice," he said at last, "if you ask me questions I
suppose I must answer them in one way or another. But&mdash;I
think I had rather you did not." He felt that every
nerve was strained in self-control as she listened to him.
"Mrs. Romaine," he went on deliberately, "is not a
woman that I like&mdash;or&mdash;respect. I would very much prefer
not to talk about her."</p>

<p>"I must tell you just one thing," she whispered, "it was
my feeling about her&mdash;my jealousy of her&mdash;that made me
leave you&mdash;twelve years ago."</p>

<p>She had surprised him now. "Alice! Impossible," he
said. "Why, my poor girl, there was not the slightest reason.
I can most solemnly swear to you, Alice, that I never
had any other feeling for Mrs. Romaine than that of ordinary
friendship. My dear, will you never believe that you
have always been the one woman in all the world for me?"</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Caspar," she murmured, "I do believe
it now."</p>

<hr style="visibility: hidden; margin: 1em;">

<p>At the same hour, a haggard and despairing woman
raised herself from the floor where she had lain for many
weary hours, trying by passionate tears and cries and outbursts
of unavailing lamentation to exhaust or stifle the
anguish which seemed to have reached its most intolerable
point. Her robes were soiled and crushed, her hair was
dishevelled, her eyes were red with weeping; and, as she
rose, she wrung her hands together and then raised them
in appeal to the God whom she had so long forgotten and
forsaken.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God," she cried, "how can I bear it? All
that I do is useless. I may lie and cheat and plot as much
as I like, but all my schemes are in vain. I cannot hurt
her, as she said: I cannot punish him: I have no power
left. No power, no beauty, no will! Am I losing my
senses, too, like Francis?" She shuddered at the thought.
"Perhaps I am going mad&mdash;they have driven me mad,<a name="Page_339"></a>
Caspar Brooke and his wife, between them&mdash;mad, mad,
mad!&mdash;Oh, God," she said, with a long shivering sigh,
"Oh, God, avert <i>that</i> doom! Not that punishment of all
others, for mercy's sake!"</p>

<p>She looked up and down her dimly lighted room with an
expression upon her face of horror and unrest, which bore
some resemblance to the look of one whose intellect was
becoming unhinged. It seemed as if she were afraid that
something might leap out upon her from the darkness, or
as if goblin voices might at any moment mutter in her ear.
For a long time she stood motionless in the middle of the
room, her eyes staring, her hands hanging at her sides.
Then she moved slowly to a writing-table, took a sheet of
paper and a pen, and wrote a few lines. When she had
finished she enclosed the sheet in an envelope, and addressed
it to Lady Alice Brooke. And when that was done
she rang the bell and sent the letter to the post. Then she
nodded and smiled strangely to herself.</p>

<p>"Perhaps that will atone," she murmured vaguely.
"And perhaps God will not take away my reason, after
all."</p>

<p>And then she began to fumble among the things upon
her dressing-table for the little bottle that contained her
nightly sleeping draught.</p>

<hr style="visibility: hidden; margin: 1em;">

<p>Mrs. Romaine's letter was brought to Lady Alice before
she rose next morning. It contained these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I told you what was not true to-day. Your husband
never asked me to go away with him&mdash;he never cared for
me. I loved him, that was all. His carelessness drove
me mad&mdash;I tried to revenge myself on him by making you
suffer. But you would not believe me, and you were
right. Pity me if you can, and pray for me.</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Rosalind Romaine.</span>"</p></div>

<p>"Ah, poor soul!" thought Alice Brooke, her eyes filling
with tears. "I do pity her&mdash;I do, with all my heart. God
help her!"</p>

<p>And she said those words again&mdash;useless as they might
be&mdash;when, by and by, a messenger came hurrying to the
house with the news that Mrs. Romaine had been found
dead that morning&mdash;dead, from an overdose of the chloral
which she kept beside her for sleeplessness. And so the<a name="Page_340"></a>
life of false aims and perverted longings came to its
appointed end.</p>

<hr style="visibility: hidden; margin: 1em;">

<p>There was never a cloud on Alice Brooke's domestic
happiness, never a shadow of distrust between her and her
husband, after this. For some little time they changed
their mode of life&mdash;giving up the house in Bloomsbury and
spending long, blissful months in Italy and the Tyrol. It
was like another honeymoon. And when they returned to
London, Caspar took a house in a sunnier and pleasanter
region than Upper Woburn Place, but not so far away as
to prevent him from visiting the Macclesfield Club on Sundays,
and having a chat with Jim Gregson and his other
workman friends. These workmen and their wives came
also in their turn to Mr. Brooke's abode, where there was
not only a gentle and gracious lady to preside at the table
(where twelve especially valued silver spoons always held
a place of honor), but a very remarkable baby in the nursery;
and it was Mr. Brooke's continual regret that he had
not insisted on naming his son and heir Macclesfield, after
the workmen's buildings, instead of the more commonplace
Maurice, after Maurice Kenyon. But Maurice and
Lesley returned the compliment by calling their eldest
child Caspar, although Lesley did say saucily that she
thought it a very ugly name.</p>

<p>Francis Trent was in a lunatic asylum, "at Her Majesty's
pleasure." His wife was allowed to see him now and
then; and on this account she would not leave England,
as some of her friends urged her to do, but occupied herself
with needlework and some kind of district visiting
among the poor. The Brookes and the Kenyons were
both exceedingly kind to her, and would have been kinder
if she had felt it possible to accept "their kindness"; but,
although she cherished in secret a strong affection for
Lesley, she was too much ashamed of her past conduct
ever to present herself to them again. She could but live
and work in silence, until one of the two great healers,
Time or Death, should soothe the bitterness of her heart
away.</p>

<p>And Ethel?&mdash;Well, Mrs. Harry Duchesne knows more
about Ethel than I do, and I shall be happy to refer you
to her.</p>
